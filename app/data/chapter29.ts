      "summary": "Addition polymerisation is the process by which small molecules called monomers join together to form a large molecule known as a polymer without any by-products released. For example, poly(ethene) is formed from the polymerisation of ethene (C2H4) where the double bond in ethene breaks to allow the molecules to link together. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nC2H4 -> [ -C2H4- ]n  (where n represents a large but variable number of repeat units).\n\nSimilarly, poly(propene) is formed from propene (C3H6), where the double bond in propene breaks to link together multiple propene monomers:\n\nC3H6 -> [ -C3H6- ]n.\n\nChloroethene, known as vinyl chloride, polymerises to form poly(chloroethene) or PVC (polyvinyl chloride), represented as:\n\nC2H3Cl -> [ -C2H3Cl- ]n.\n\nThe uses of these polymers vary:\n- Poly(ethene) is commonly used for plastic bags and packaging, existing as low-density poly(ethene) (LDPE) and high-density poly(ethene) (HDPE).\n- Poly(propene) is stronger than poly(ethene) and is used for making items like crates and ropes.\n- Poly(chloroethene) is rigid and used for pipes, insulation, and flexible products with added plasticisers.\n\nDisposal problems for addition polymers include:\n1. Inertness and inability to biodegrade: Addition polymers like poly(ethene) and poly(chloroethene) are made of strong covalent bonds, making them non-biodegradable and remaining unchanged in the environment for thousands of years.\n2. Toxicity: Incineration of these polymers releases toxic gases, including carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride, along with carbon dioxide contributing to global warming. \n\nThus, viable solutions for disposal include recycling, though many polymers resist degradation and remain in landfill sites for extended periods.",

For example, in the repeat unit of poly(ethene), the monomer is derived by recognizing that it consists of two carbon atoms each bonded to two hydrogen atoms, leading to the formula C2H4. Conversely, to derive the repeat unit from a given monomer, you illustrate how the atoms would connect by removing any double bonds between monomers and forming single bonds to create the polymer chain.",

The polymer formed is called poly(ethene), which is more commonly known as polythene. The resulting polymer is saturated, meaning it contains single bonds only, and therefore, it will not decolourise bromine water, indicating that it does not undergo further reactions typical of unsaturated compounds.

In addition polymerisation, a lot of ethene molecules combine to form a chain without the loss of any atoms; the double bonds of the ethene break and the monomer molecules add onto each other. In contrast, the process of making a polyester typically involves two different types of monomers that join together alternately. In this process, every time two monomers combine, a small molecule, such as water or hydrogen chloride, is eliminated. This elimination of water is why it is called condensation polymerisation. One type of monomer used in making polyesters is a diol, which is an alcohol molecule containing one -OH group at each end. For example, ethane-1,2-diol has the structural formula CH₂(OH)CH₂(OH), indicating it has two carbon atoms and two -OH groups attached to carbons number 1 and 2.
