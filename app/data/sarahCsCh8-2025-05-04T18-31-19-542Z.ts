Additionally, a utility program that can be a component of a disk formatter performs disk contents analysis and, if possible, disk repair when needed by first checking for errors on the disk. Errors may arise from physical defects resulting in bad sectors, often caused during manufacture or from mishandling, such as moving the computer without securing the disk heads. Other errors might result from events like loss of power or sudden system shutdowns, leading to unusable files. A disk repair utility can mark bad sectors, ensuring the file system avoids them, and may recover data when file integrity is affected; otherwise, it deletes the files.",

File fragmentation occurs due to the constant creation, editing, and deletion of files, which leaves spare sectors unfilled and disrupts the logical arrangement of data in sectors. As a result, files cannot be stored as single blocks of data. For instance, when File B is deleted from a disk, the corresponding sector remains unfilled, leading to fragmentation. When a file like File A is later extended, it may occupy sectors non-contiguously, thus exacerbating the fragmentation issue. A defragmenter improves this by consolidating files, but may take significant time, especially on large disks, and cannot effectively operate if the disk is too full.",

They are often tried and tested, increasing reliability.

However, linking library routines into executable code has disadvantages; each program requires its own copy, leading to increased storage space and memory usage. In contrast, dynamic linked libraries (DLL) allow multiple processes to share a single routine stored separately in memory, minimizing storage needs and memory usage. DLLs facilitate automatic upgrades when new versions of routines are available.
