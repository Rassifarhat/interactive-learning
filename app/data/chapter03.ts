          "summary": "An atom is the smallest piece of an element that can still be recognized as that element. For example, if you cut copper into smaller pieces, eventually, you would reach an individual copper atom which retains its properties. A molecule, on the other hand, is made up of two or more atoms bonded together. \n\nAtoms are composed of sub-atomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom and have a relative mass of approximately 1 and a positive charge of +1. Neutrons are also found in the nucleus, have a relative mass of approximately 1, and carry no charge (neutral). Electrons orbit around the nucleus in energy levels and have a very small relative mass (approximately 1/1836 of a proton) and a negative charge of -1. \n\nThe atomic number (Z) of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus, which determines the element's identity. The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Isotopes are variants of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, leading to different mass numbers. The relative atomic mass (A) of an element is a weighted average of all the isotopes of that element based on their natural abundances. \n\nTo calculate the relative atomic mass of an element from isotopic abundances, use the formula: A = (percentage abundance of isotope 1 × mass of isotope 1 + percentage abundance of isotope 2 × mass of isotope 2 + ...) / 100. This calculation provides the average mass of an atom of the element in atomic mass units (amu).",
