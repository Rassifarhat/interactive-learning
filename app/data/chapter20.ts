Measure the rate of reaction with hydrochloric acid (HCl) by monitoring the amount of gas produced or the time taken for the solid to disappear. The smaller particles (powdered form) should react faster due to increased surface area.  \n2. Investigating Concentration: Use a solution of sodium thiosulfate and measure the time taken for a cross beneath the solution to disappear when reacting with hydrochloric acid. Vary the concentration of sodium thiosulfate and observe how the reaction rate changes. Higher concentrations will typically lead to faster reactions due to more frequent collisions between particles.  \n3. Investigating Temperature: Conduct a reaction at different temperatures, using the same reactants (e.g., sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid). Record reaction times at various temperatures (e.g., 0°C, 25°C, 50°C). The increase in temperature provides molecules with more energy, leading to more frequent collisions and an increased reaction rate.  \n4. Investigating Catalysts: Use a reaction that involves hydrogen peroxide decomposing into water and oxygen gas using manganese dioxide as a catalyst. Observe the rate of oxygen gas production with and without the catalyst. The presence of the catalyst should speed up the reaction without being consumed, indicating it provides an alternative pathway with lower activation energy.",

If the products are at a lower energy level than the reactants, ΔH is negative (exothermic reaction), while if the products are higher, ΔH is positive (endothermic reaction).\n\n**Effects of Changing Surface Area of Marble Chips and Concentration of Hydrochloric Acid on Rate of Reaction**:\n- Increasing surface area (by using smaller chips or powdered marble) increases the rate of reaction because more particles are exposed to the acid, leading to more frequent collisions.\n- Increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid means there are more acid particles in a given volume, which also increases the frequency of collisions. Therefore, both factors can significantly affect the rate of reaction between marble chips and dilute hydrochloric acid.\n\n**Investigating the Catalytic Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide**:\n- This investigation typically involves different solids (like manganese dioxide, potassium iodide) as catalysts that speed up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The effectiveness of different solids can be measured by the volume of oxygen produced over time, demonstrating how varying catalyst types influence the reaction kinetics.",

Add the hydrochloric acid to the marble chips in the flask. 6. Record the mass on the balance at 30-second intervals during the reaction. 7.

In this experiment, it is noted that the marble chips were in excess, meaning that all of the hydrochloric acid is consumed during the reaction, leaving unreacted marble chips at the end. The average rate of the reaction can be calculated during any time interval using the formula: rate = mass of CO2 lost / time. For example, in the first minute, if 0.47 g of CO2 is lost, the rate is calculated as 0.47 g/min. In the second minute, if 0.20 g of CO2 is lost, the rate is 0.20 g/min. The average rate over the first two minutes can be averaged as 0.67 g divided by 2, resulting in 0.34 g/min. Observing the progression, the reaction rate is initially highest, then it slows down and eventually stops once all hydrochloric acid is consumed. At any point, the instantaneous rate can be found by determining the slope (gradient) of the tangent to the curve at that specific time. For example, at 5 minutes, the rate is approximately 0.05 g/min. Additionally, the volume of CO2 produced can also be measured using specific apparatus to track the reaction rate.",

In the context of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate, the relevant particles are the $\text{H}^{+}$ ions from the acid and the $\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ ions from the calcium carbonate. A successful reaction occurs when these $\text{H}^{+}$ ions collide with the carbonate ions, provided that they do so with a sufficient amount of energy, known as the activation energy. Not every collision results in a reaction; many particles simply bounce off each other. As the reaction progresses and the acid particles are consumed, the rate of collisions decreases, leading to a slower reaction. Consequently, in experiments, it is common to plot graphs showing the mass or volume of product formed or the concentration of the reactant over time. The steepness of the graph indicates the rate of reaction - where it is steepest, the reaction is fastest, and it will eventually level off when all acid has been consumed.",

Smaller marble chips have a greater surface area in contact with the dilute hydrochloric acid compared to larger chips. This increased surface area means that more particles of the solid are exposed and available for collision with the acid molecules. Since only the particles on the surface can collide with the acid, having more surface area leads to a higher frequency of successful collisions. Consequently, the reaction with smaller chips starts off much faster and finishes sooner, producing the same mass of carbon dioxide as the larger chips but in a shorter amount of time.

In contrast, a zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactants; increasing the concentration will have no effect on the rate.

To prepare different concentrations of hydrochloric acid, we will dilute an original solution of 2.00 mol/dm³ by adding distilled water, ensuring that the total volume of acid and water remains 25 cm³. For example, mixing 12.5 cm³ of the original HCl with 12.5 cm³ of distilled water results in a concentration of 1.00 mol/dm³. Alternatively, mixing 5 cm³ of HCl with 20 cm³ of distilled water gives a concentration of 0.40 mol/dm³. During the experiment, we will measure the mass of carbon dioxide released over 30 seconds to calculate the average rate of reaction using the formula: average rate = mass loss / 30. If the mass loss is 0.32 g, the average rate is calculated as 0.011 g/s. To determine the effect of concentration on reaction rate, we will plot the results on graph paper with the rate on the y-axis and the concentration on the x-axis. The line of best fit should pass through the origin, indicating that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, if the concentration doubles, the reaction rate should also double, and similarly for tripling concentration.",

The second and more significant factor is that a relatively small increase in temperature results in a large increase in the number of particles that have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy required for a reaction to occur.
