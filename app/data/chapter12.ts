At room temperature, fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, bromine is a reddish-brown liquid, iodine is a dark purple solid, and astatine is a radioactive solid. The trend in physical properties among the halogens shows that as you move down Group 7, the state changes from gas to liquid to solid, and the colours become darker. This trend indicates increasing molecular size and increased van der Waals forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points down the group. Knowledge of these trends allows predictions for other halogens based on their position in the periodic table. For example, a hypothetical halogen below astatine could be assumed to be solid and possibly dark in color. Displacement reactions provide evidence for reactivity trends; more reactive halogens can displace less reactive halogens from their compounds. For example, chlorine can displace bromine from potassium bromide solution, indicating that chlorine is more reactive than bromine. This reactivity trend follows the order: fluorine > chlorine > bromine > iodine.",

          "summary": "The reactivity of the halogens in Group 7 decreases down the group as the atomic number increases. This trend can be explained by considering the electronic configurations of the halogens. Group 7 elements have seven electrons in their outer shell (valence shell), which means they need one more electron to achieve a stable octet configuration. As we move down the group from fluorine to iodine, the number of electron shells increases. This leads to a greater distance between the nucleus and the outer shell electrons, which reduces the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons. Additionally, the increased electron shielding from inner shells further diminishes the attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons. As a result, the ability of the halogens to gain an additional electron decreases down the group, thus reducing their reactivity. Therefore, fluorine is the most reactive, followed by chlorine, bromine, and iodine, which is the least reactive.",

The halogens are non-metallic and exist as diatomic molecules: F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2. Furthermore, the physical properties show a trend as you move down the group: the melting and boiling points increase, and the colors become darker. Specifically, at room temperature, F2 is a yellow gas, Cl2 is a green gas, Br2 is a red-brown liquid with orange/brown vapor, and I2 exists as a grey solid that sublimates to form a purple vapor.",
