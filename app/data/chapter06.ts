This means that if you have 100 cm³ of hydrogen at some temperature and pressure, it contains exactly the same number of molecules as there are in 100 cm³ of Cl2, or any other gas under those conditions, irrespective of the size of the molecules. For example, in the chemical reaction where methane (CH4) reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), the balanced equation is: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l). In this reaction, two O2 molecules are needed to react with each CH4 molecule, so if we start with 100 cm³ of CH4, we will need twice that volume of O2, which amounts to 200 cm³ of O2. Therefore, 100 cm³ of methane will react exactly with 200 cm³ of oxygen gas, resulting in the formation of 100 cm³ of carbon dioxide gas.",

We know the volume is 50 cm³, which needs to be converted to dm³ by dividing by 1000, giving us 0.050 dm³. The concentration of ethanoic acid is 2 mol/dm³. Therefore, the number of moles of CH₃COOH is: number of moles = volume × concentration = 0.050 dm³ × 2 mol/dm³ = 0.1 mol. 2. Use the balanced chemical equation: CaCO₃(s) + 2 CH₃COOH(aq) → Ca(CH₃COO)₂(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(l). This tells us that 2 moles of CH₃COOH react with 1 mole of CaCO₃. Therefore, the number of moles of CaCO₃ that react with 0.1 mol of CH₃COOH is: 0.1 mol CH₃COOH × (1 mol CaCO₃ / 2 mol CH₃COOH) = 0.05 mol CaCO₃. 3. Calculate the mass of CaCO₃. The molar mass of CaCO₃ (with Ar: Ca = 40, C = 12, O = 16) is: 40 + 12 + (16 × 3) = 100 g/mol. Thus, the mass of CaCO₃ that can be removed is: mass = number of moles × molar mass = 0.05 mol × 100 g/mol = 5 g. Therefore, the ethanoic acid reacts with 5 g of calcium carbonate.",

Add a few drops of an appropriate indicator to the alkali solution. 3. Perform the titration: Open the burette tap to add the acid solution slowly to the alkali in the conical flask while constantly swirling the flask to mix the solutions. 4. Observe the color change: Continue adding the acid until a permanent color change occurs in the solution, indicating that the endpoint has been reached. 5.

The process involves measuring a solution of an alkali into a conical flask using a pipette. An acid is then gradually added from a burette while swirling the flask constantly. Towards the end of the titration, the acid is added drop by drop until the indicator changes color, indicating the endpoint of the reaction. If the concentration of either the acid or the alkali is known, the results of the titration can be used to calculate the concentration of the other solution. This technique is commonly used in acid-alkali titrations, as discussed in Chapters 16 and 17. Remember to divide the volume by 1000 to convert to dm^3.",
