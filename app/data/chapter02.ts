Mixtures can be separated by physical means, such as using a magnet to separate iron from sulfur, where iron is attracted to the magnet and sulfur is not. The elements in a compound like FeS cannot be separated by physical means; they require chemical reactions, such as to produce iron and sulfur. Additionally, cooling hydrogen and oxygen gases can separate them physically, as oxygen condenses into a liquid at -183°C and hydrogen at -253°C.

For instance, dissolving 10 g of common salt (sodium chloride) in 1 litre of water lowers the melting point to about -0.6°C and raises the boiling point to about 100.2°C. Measuring the melting point of a substance can be very useful to determine its purity. If a sample's melting point is recorded and shows a range (e.g., 128-134°C for aspirin, which has a pure melting point of 138°C), it indicates impurity because it melts over a wider range of temperatures than that of the pure substance.",

During fractional distillation, the mixture is heated, and as it reaches the boiling point of ethanol, the ethanol vapour rises through the fractionating column. The column is often packed with glass beads or a similar material to increase the surface area, which enhances the separation of the two vapours. Although separation can be achieved with an empty column, a high surface area is more effective.

If the dye does not move from the pencil line during an experiment, it indicates that the dye is not soluble in the solvent being used, necessitating a search for a different solvent. Conversely, if the dye moves with the solvent front, it suggests that the dye is too soluble in that solvent, again requiring the use of an alternative solvent. Additionally, paper chromatography can separate mixtures of colourless substances like sugars, but these need to be made visible by some method to observe the spots on the paper.

Cover the beaker with a lid, such as a watch glass, to keep the atmosphere saturated with solvent and minimize evaporation. 5. Once the solvent ascends to about 1 cm from the top, remove the paper and mark the solvent front with a pencil. 6. Allow the paper to dry completely to evaporate all the solvent. You may use water or a non-aqueous solvent depending on the substances in the mixture, and suitable solvents can be determined through experimentation. The dyes have different affinities for the paper and varying solubility in the solvent. For example, a dye that moves less may have high affinity for the paper or low solubility in the solvent, while one that moves far may have low affinity for the paper and high solubility in the solvent. The resulting pattern on the paper is known as a chromatogram, indicating the presence of at least three different dyes, as spots may represent individual dyes or mixtures.",

It is calculated using the formula R_t = (distance moved by a spot) / (distance moved by the solvent front). R_t values range from 0 to 1, and a value greater than 1 suggests a calculation error. In the given example, the R_t values for the dyes in the mixture (m) are: blue spot: R_t = 0.25, orange spot: R_t = 0.56, green spot: R_t = 0.81. The individual dyes had the following R_t values: dye d1: R_t = 0.56, dye d2: R_t = 0.36, dye d3: R_t = 0.81, dye d4: R_t = 0.25. By comparing the R_t values of the mixture with those of the individual dyes, it was concluded that the mixture contains dyes d1, d3, and d4, as their R_t values matched those observed in the mixture.",
