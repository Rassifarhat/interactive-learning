This reaction is classified as both a displacement reaction and a redox reaction. The results of the experiment showed the following masses: mass of empty dish = 23.78 g, mass of dish + copper oxide = 26.96 g, and mass of dish + contents at the end of the experiment = 26.32 g. \n\nTo calculate the mass of copper oxide at the beginning, we can subtract the mass of the empty dish from the mass of the dish + copper oxide:\nMass of copper oxide = 26.96 g - 23.78 g = 3.18 g.\n\nTo find the mass of copper remaining at the end, we subtract the mass of the empty dish from the mass of the dish + contents:\nMass of copper = 26.32 g - 23.78 g = 2.54 g.\n\nThe mass decreases because the hydrogen combines with the oxygen from copper oxide to form water. This indicates that oxygen is removed from the copper oxide, leading us to say that copper oxide has been reduced. \n\nTo find the mass of oxygen, we subtract the mass of copper from the mass of copper oxide:\nMass of oxygen = 3.18 g - 2.54 g = 0.64 g.\n\nNow, we have 2.54 g of copper combining with 0.64 g of oxygen. To deduce the empirical formula, we calculate the number of moles of each element:\nNumber of moles of copper = 2.54 g / 63.5 g/mol = 0.0400 mol;\nNumber of moles of oxygen = 0.64 g / 16 g/mol = 0.040 mol.\n\nNext, we divide by the smaller number of moles to find the ratio:\nRatio of moles of Cu = 0.0400 mol / 0.040 mol = 1;\nRatio of moles of O = 0.040 mol / 0.040 mol = 1. \n\nThus, the empirical formula is CuO. \n\nSafety precautions for the experiment include: the teacher must wear a face shield and use safety screens, students must wear eye protection, and they should remain at least 2 meters away during the demonstration. If a drying agent is needed, anhydrous calcium chloride should be used instead of concentrated sulfuric acid.",

The mass of water collected in the U-tube is calculated as follows: 26.32 g (mass of dish + contents at end) - 23.78 g (mass of empty dish) = 2.54 g. Since the mass of water collected is given as 0.72 g, we use this value for calculations.\n\n3. **Mass of oxygen and hydrogen**: The mass of oxygen lost from copper(II) oxide during the reaction is 0.64 g. Hence, the mass of oxygen in the produced water is 0.64 g.

Thus, 6.25 mol of Fe2O3 produces: \n\n6.25 mol Fe2O3 × 2 mol Fe / 1 mol Fe2O3 = 12.5 mol Fe. \n\nTo find the mass of iron produced, we multiply the number of moles of Fe by the molar mass of Fe (which is 56 g/mol): \n\nmass = number of moles × molar mass \nmass = 12.5 mol × 56 g/mol = 700 g. \n\nTherefore, the mass of iron that can be formed from 1000 g of iron oxide (Fe2O3) is 700 g.",
