The formation of a green precipitate indicates the presence of iron(II) ions, which is iron(II) hydroxide ($\\mathrm{Fe(OH)_{2}}$). The relevant chemical reaction is: $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 2 \\mathrm{OH}^{-}(\text{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Fe(OH)_{2}}(\text{s})$. An example of a reaction that could provide this outcome is the reaction of iron(II) sulfate solution with sodium hydroxide solution: $\\mathrm{FeSO_{4}}(\text{aq}) + 2 \\mathrm{NaOH}(\text{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Fe(OH)_{2}}(\text{s}) + \\mathrm{Na_{2}SO_{4}}(\text{aq})$.

In cold conditions, the small amount of ammonia gas produced can be detected by careful smelling, following safety precautions. It is essential to avoid this if you have a breathing problem, such as asthma, and no attempt should be made to smell the gas when the mixture is warm. Instead, when warmed, the gas can be tested using damp red litmus paper or universal indicator paper, as ammonia is alkaline and will turn the paper blue. The ionic equation for the reaction is: NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq) → NH3(g) + H2O(l). For a solid ammonium salt (e.g., ammonium chloride), the full equation is: NH4Cl(s) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + NH3(g) + H2O(l). It is important to note that for ammonium ions, no precipitate is formed when sodium hydroxide is added; instead, ammonia gas is produced.",

The reaction is as follows:  \n   $$ \\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{SO}^{2-}_{4}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}(\\mathrm{s}) $$  \n   A white precipitate of barium sulfate indicates the presence of sulfate ions. Acid is added to remove other anions, such as carbonate ions, which could also produce precipitates (barium carbonate is white and insoluble). It is crucial to never use sulfuric acid for acidification as it would introduce sulfate ions, resulting in a false positive for sulfate. \n\n2. **Silver Chloride**: To test for chloride ions, make a solution of the suspected chloride and add enough dilute nitric acid to make the solution acidic, then add silver nitrate solution. The reaction is as follows:  \n   $$ \\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AgCl}(\\mathrm{s}) $$  \n   A white precipitate of silver chloride confirms the presence of chloride ions.  \n \n3. **Silver Bromide**: Similarly, to test for bromide ions, the same procedure applies as for chloride ions, and the reaction is:  \n   $$ \\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{Br}^{-}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AgBr}(\\mathrm{s}) $$  \n   A cream precipitate indicates the presence of bromide.  \n \n4. **Silver Iodide**: To test for iodide ions using silver nitrate solution, the reaction is:  \n   $$ \\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{I}^{-}(\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AgI}(\\mathrm{s}) $$  \n   A yellow precipitate shows the presence of iodide ions.  \n\n5. **Testing for Carbon Dioxide**: To test if carbon dioxide is produced (e.g. during the reaction of zinc carbonate with dilute nitric acid), the gas can be bubbled through limewater. The reaction produces a white precipitate of calcium carbonate in limewater if carbon dioxide is present:  \n   $$ \\mathrm{Ca(OH)_{2}}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{g}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\\mathrm{s}) \\downarrow $$  \n   The limewater will turn cloudy or milky.",
