In this case, the diagram should represent the regular arrangement of Ca2+ ions, noting that there are fewer delocalised electrons compared to potassium due to the two outer electrons from each calcium atom being delocalised.",

In the diagram, the cations are represented as small, densely packed spheres arranged in a regular pattern, while the delocalized electrons are illustrated as dots or a cloud around the cations. This model reflects the nature of metallic bonding, which is characterized by electrostatic attractions between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged delocalized electrons. This bonding gives rise to distinct physical properties of metals, such as electrical conductivity due to the mobility of electrons, allowing them to carry charge, and malleability, which enables metals to be deformed without breaking due to the ability of the layers of cations to slide over one another while the electron cloud remains intact.",

In this structure, the outer electron of each sodium atom becomes delocalised, meaning it is free to move throughout the entire metal lattice. These delocalised electrons are not attached to specific atoms, but instead flow around the whole structure. When a sodium atom loses its outer electron, it becomes a sodium ion (Na+), resulting in a regular arrangement of positive sodium ions surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. This arrangement of ions and electrons creates a metallic lattice structure.",

In a metallic structure, atoms lose some of their outer electrons, which become delocalized and form a 'sea of electrons' that can move freely throughout the metal lattice. When an electric potential difference is applied, these free electrons can flow easily, allowing the metal to conduct electrical current. Additionally, the metallic bonds provide a strong lattice structure that supports the movement of these electrons without breaking.",

          "summary": "Ionic compounds conduct electricity when they are molten or in aqueous solution because the ions are free to move. In solid form, ionic substances do not conduct electricity as the ions are not free to move. In contrast, metals conduct electricity whether they are solid or molten due to the presence of delocalised electrons that are free to move. It is essential to distinguish between the two: ionic substances rely on the movement of ions, while metals depend on the movement of electrons. Metallic bonding is characterized by the electrostatic forces of attraction between positive ions and delocalised electrons, which holds the metallic structure together. Metals have giant structures with no individual molecules, and all positive ions in the lattice attract the delocalised electrons. The ion formed by a metal depends on the number of electrons in the outer shell of the original atom, resulting in Group 1 elements forming 1+ ions and Group 2 elements forming 2+ ions.",

          "id": "2-8",
          "summary": "Most metals are hard and have high melting points due to strong electrostatic forces of attraction between positive ions and delocalised electrons. For example, sodium has one delocalised electron per atom, resulting in ions with a +1 charge, leading to weaker bonding, making sodium relatively soft with a low melting point. In contrast, magnesium has two delocalised electrons, forming +2 charged ions, which results in stronger electrostatic attractions and higher melting points. Metals also conduct electricity because delocalised electrons can move freely throughout the structure. When a piece of metal is connected to an electrical power source, these moving electrons allow for electrical conduction. Additionally, metals are malleable, meaning they can be hammered into different shapes. When a force is applied, the layers of positive ions in a metal can slide over each other without breaking the metallic bonds, as the ions remain attracted to the delocalised electrons.",

This ability to rearrange allows metals to be shaped into different forms. Similarly, metals are also described as ductile, which means they can be drawn out into wires. The explanation for ductility is the same as for malleability; the layers of positive ions can slide over each other without breaking the metallic bonds.",
