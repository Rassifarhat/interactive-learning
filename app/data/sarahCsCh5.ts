It executes instructions from computer programs through the fetch-decode-execute cycle. The key components of a processor include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs mathematical operations; the control unit (CU), which directs the operation of the processor; and registers, which are small storage locations for holding temporary data and instructions. Additionally, processors may utilize cache memory to speed up data access. The performance of a processor is often measured by its clock speed (in GHz), which indicates how many cycles per second it can execute, and other factors such as the number of cores, which can allow it to process multiple tasks simultaneously. Modern processors also implement various architectures and may support hyper-threading to improve efficiency.",

A vital part of the control unit is a clock that synchronises processes.

          "summary": "Registers are storage components within the CPU, located close to the ALU, allowing for very short access times. Each register typically has a limited storage capacity of 16, 32, or 64 bits. Registers can be divided into general-purpose and special-purpose registers. The general-purpose register, referred to as the Accumulator, stores a single value at any one time, which is used by the ALU for the execution of instructions. After execution, a different value can be stored in the Accumulator. The special-purpose registers in a simple CPU include: \n\n1. Current Instruction Register (CIR) - Stores the current instruction while it is being decoded and executed.\n2. Index Register (IX) - Stores a value for indexed addressing.\n3. Memory Address Register (MAR) - Holds the address of a memory location or I/O component that is about to be read from or written to.\n4. Memory Data Register (MDR or MBR) - Acts as a buffer for data that has just been read from memory or is about to be written to memory. \n5. Program Counter (PC) - Stores the address of where the next instruction is to be read from.\n6. Status Register (SR) - Contains individual bits that act as logical flags, which are set to 1 if a condition (such as carry, negative, or overflow) is detected. \n\nIt is important to note that the MDR functions as a buffer due to the varying speeds of data transfer within and outside the processor. Additionally, the IX is always abbreviated as such in this context, while the CIR is consistently abbreviated as CIR to avoid confusion with other notations. All special-purpose registers (except the status register) represent one value, while the status register is characterized by multiple bits, each serving as a flag for specific conditions.",

The program counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. This address is transferred to the Memory Address Register (MAR). 2. During the next clock cycle, two actions occur simultaneously: the instruction located at the address in the MAR is fetched into the Memory Data Register (MDR), and the program counter is incremented to point to the next instruction. 3. The instruction stored in the MDR is then transferred to the Current Instruction Register (CIR). 4. It is important to note that the system clock controls the clock cycle, allowing one data transfer from memory in the defined time for each cycle. 5. Although the program counter is incremented by 1 in the final step, if the fetched instruction is a jump instruction, the program counter must be updated accordingly after decoding the instruction. In the decode stage, the control unit receives the instruction from the CIR, interprets it, and sends signals to appropriate components for execution. If the instruction requires arithmetic or logic operations, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is activated. The execute stage, where the actual operation is performed, is further described in Chapter 6, including a discussion on a simple instruction set.",

When two operations are shown on a single line, separated by a semi-colon, it indicates that these transfers occur simultaneously. An important aspect is the double pair of brackets around MAR, which signifies that the content of MAR is an address, and the data transferred to the MDR is the content of that address. For instance, in the example given: MAR - [PC] shows that the content of the Program Counter (PC) is being moved into the Memory Address Register (MAR), and then PC is incremented by 1. Following this, MDR - [[MAR]] indicates the content at the address specified by MAR is transferred into the Memory Data Register (MDR).

Detection of interrupts occurs at the end of a fetch-execute cycle, enabling the current program state to be maintained for later resumption. The handling of an interrupt involves several steps: 1) Storing the contents of the program counter and other registers in memory; 2) initiating the appropriate interrupt handler or Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) by loading its address into the program counter; 3) executing the ISR and checking for additional interrupts; 4) handling further interrupts through repeated execution of the ISR; 5) restoring the previously stored register contents and resuming the originally running program if no further interrupts exist.",
