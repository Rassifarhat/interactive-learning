The chemical equation for the reaction is: CH3COOH(l) + CH3CH2OH(l) â‡Œ CH3COOCH2CH3(l) + H2O(l). The starting materials are ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and ethanoic acid (CH3COOH). The catalyst used is concentrated sulfuric acid, which is not written into the equation because it is a catalyst and is not consumed in the reaction. The conditions for this reaction include heating the mixture. This reaction is referred to as esterification and can also be classified as a condensation reaction, as water is produced when the two molecules join together. The reaction is reversible, thus to maximize the yield of ethyl ethanoate, it is beneficial to use pure ethanol and ethanoic acid (the pure form of ethanoic acid is known as glacial ethanoic acid). The position of equilibrium shifts to counteract changes; for instance, if water is added, the system shifts to the left to consume the water, which decreases the amount of ethyl ethanoate produced.",

Next, remove a molecule of water (H2O) from the two reactants. After removing water, join what remains of the alcohol and carboxylic acid together to complete the ester structure. An ester can be represented in either orientation, but the naming convention always follows the format of naming the alcohol first and then the carboxylic acid. For example, when forming ethyl ethanoate, 'ethyl' comes from ethanol (the alcohol) and 'ethanoate' comes from ethanoic acid (the carboxylic acid). Thus, the final name of the ester is ethyl ethanoate.",

When cool, pour the mixture into a beaker half-full of 0.5 mol/dmÂ³ sodium carbonate solution, observing effervescence as the excess acid reacts with the metal carbonate; this is done to better smell the ester, as the smell of the carboxylic acid would mask it. 6. A layer of ester will separate and float on top of the water, while the acid and alcohol will mostly dissolve in the water. 7. Smell the product by gently wafting the odour towards your nose with your hand, avoiding putting your nose near the top of the beaker. 8.
