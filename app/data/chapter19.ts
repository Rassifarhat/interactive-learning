Exothermic reactions are those that release heat energy, while endothermic reactions absorb heat energy. To investigate the temperature changes associated with these reactions, simple calorimetry experiments can be conducted using different types of reactions. Examples include: 1) Salts dissolving in water, where the temperature change indicates whether the process is endothermic or exothermic; 2) Neutralization reactions, where an acid and a base react, typically releasing heat; 3) Displacement reactions, where one element displaces another in a compound, often producing observable heat changes; and 4) Combustion reactions, which are generally exothermic processes that release large amounts of heat and light. To measure the heat energy change (Q) from a measured temperature change (ΔT), the expression used is Q = ImCΔT, where I is the mass of the solution, m is the specific heat capacity, and C is the temperature change. Additionally, the molar enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated from the heat energy change, Q.",

Conversely, in an exothermic reaction, the reactants have higher energy than the products. The diagram illustrates that energy is released to the surroundings, shown as a drop in energy level from reactants to products. \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that bond breaking requires energy (an endothermic process), while bond making releases energy (an exothermic process). \n\nTo calculate the enthalpy change during a chemical reaction, use bond energies: \n\n1. Identify all the bonds broken in the reactants and their respective bond energies (the energy required for bond breaking). \n2. Identify all the bonds formed in the products and their bond energies (the energy released during bond making). \n3. Calculate the total energy required to break the bonds (sum of bond energies of broken bonds) and the total energy released from formulating bonds (sum of bond energies of formed bonds). \n4. The enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated using the formula: ΔH = Total energy of bonds broken - Total energy of bonds formed. If ΔH is positive, the reaction is endothermic (absorbs heat), and if ΔH is negative, the reaction is exothermic (releases heat).",

Dividing $Q$ by 1000 gives energy in kJ: $17.26 \\, \\mathrm{kJ}$. This indicates that 17.26 kJ of heat energy was released by the combustion of ethanol. To find the molar enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol, we first determine the mass of ethanol burned, which was the decrease in the mass of the burner: $137.36 - 136.58 = 0.78 \\, \\mathrm{g}$. Ethanol has the molecular formula $\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$, and its relative molecular mass, calculated as $(2 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) + 16 + 1 = 46$, allows us to find the number of moles ($n$) of ethanol burned: $n = \\frac{0.78}{46} = 0.01696 \\, \\mathrm{mol}$.

This discrepancy suggests that our reaction was less exothermic than expected due to several sources of error. These include significant heat loss to the environment, heat absorption by the copper can and thermometer, and the possibility of incomplete combustion of the ethanol, indicated by a yellow/orange flame and soot production rather than a blue flame, which would suggest complete combustion yielding carbon dioxide.

The heat produced from the combustion is transferred to both the water and the calorimeter itself, allowing for a precise calculation of the enthalpy change. When comparing different alcohols under similar conditions, it can be observed that as the alcohol chain length increases, the combustion reaction becomes more exothermic. In other words, longer alcohols release more heat energy per mole when they undergo combustion compared to shorter alcohols. This increase in heat evolved is consistent and regular; with each additional –CH₂ group added to the alcohol structure, there is a proportional increase in the amount of energy released. Thus, the number of extra bonds broken and formed also increases systematically, leading to a regular increase in the heat evolved as the chain length of the alcohol increases.",

Record the initial temperature of the potassium hydroxide solution. 4. Fill a burette with 50.00 cm³ of dilute hydrochloric acid. 5.

Plot a graph of the temperature of the mixture against the volume of hydrochloric acid added; two lines of best fit can be drawn, and the point where they intersect indicates complete neutralisation. 8. Identify the maximum temperature reached; for this example, it is 31.8°C after adding 28.00 cm³ of hydrochloric acid. 9. To calculate the heat released, use the formula Q = mcΔT, where m = total volume of solution (in grams, assuming the density is 1 g/cm³, total volume = 25 cm³ KOH + 28 cm³ HCl = 53 cm³), c = specific heat capacity (4.18 J/g°C), and ΔT = maximum temperature (31.8°C) - initial temperature (19.3°C).

The overall reaction can be represented as: 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l). In this reaction, the products (water) are more stable than the reactants (hydrogen and oxygen), signifying that energy is released. Conversely, in endothermic reactions, such as the decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) upon heating, more energy is consumed to break the bonds in the original compound than is released when new bonds are formed in the products. This results in a net absorption of heat from the surroundings. Therefore, reactions can be classified based on whether they absorb or release energy during the bond breaking and forming process.",
