      "id": "topic7-1",
      "summary": "London forces are instantaneous‑dipole → induced‑dipole attractions created by momentary fluctuations in electron density. The force increases with the number of electrons and with the surface area (points of contact) between molecules; it is present in *all* molecules, polar or non‑polar. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

      "name": "Explain permanent dipole–permanent dipole interactions.",
      "id": "topic7-2",
      "summary": "Molecules that possess a built‑in (permanent) separation of charge attract each other when their δ+ and δ− ends align. In liquids or gases this alignment is only partial, so the average attraction is usually weaker than London forces in the same substance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"

      "name": "Define a hydrogen bond and state the conditions required for its formation.",
      "id": "topic7-3",
      "summary": "A hydrogen bond is an intermolecular interaction showing partial bond character between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative, small atom (N, O, or F) and a lone pair on another electronegative atom. Directionality (≈ 180°) and spectroscopic evidence distinguish it from a simple dipole interaction. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}"

      "name": "Describe and compare the hydrogen bonding in H₂O, NH₃ and HF; predict another molecule that will hydrogen‑bond strongly.",
      "id": "topic7-4",
      "summary": "• **H₂O**: each molecule offers two lone pairs and two δ+ H atoms → network of up to four H‑bonds, giving extensive three‑dimensional bonding.\n• **HF**: stronger individual H‑bonds (F very electronegative) but only two bonds per molecule; HF exists as short chains/polymers.\n• **NH₃**: only one lone pair → on average one H‑bond donated and one accepted per molecule, so overall network is weaker.\nA close analogue predicted to show strong H‑bonding is **CH₃COOH (ethanoic acid)**, which dimerises via O–H···O bonds. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}"

      "id": "topic7-5",
      "summary": "The extensive four‑link hydrogen‑bond network in liquid water requires large amounts of energy to disrupt, so both Tₘ and T_b are far above those of hydrides with similar Mr that rely mainly on London forces. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}"

      "name": "Why is ice less dense than liquid water at 0 °C?",
      "id": "topic7-6",
      "summary": "In ice, water molecules form open hexagonal rings held by H‑bonds, leaving sizeable voids. On melting, the ring structure collapses, molecules pack closer, and density increases—hence ice floats. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}"

      "name": "Describe the trend in boiling temperature of unbranched alkanes as chain length increases.",
      "id": "topic7-7",
      "summary": "Boiling temperature rises steadily because (i) more electrons give larger instantaneous/induced dipoles and (ii) longer chains provide more surface contact points, strengthening cumulative London forces. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}"

      "name": "How does branching affect the boiling temperature of alkanes?",
      "id": "topic7-8",
      "summary": "Greater branching lowers boiling temperature: compact shapes reduce contact area between molecules, so overall London attraction is weaker compared with straight‑chain isomers. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}"

      "summary": "Alcohols possess an O–H group that introduces hydrogen bonding in addition to London forces. This extra intermolecular attraction requires more energy to separate molecules, raising T_b relative to isoelectronic alkanes (e.g., CH₃OH vs C₂H₆). :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}"

      "id": "topic7-10",
      "summary": "From HCl to HI the steady rise in T_b reflects increasing electrons and stronger London forces; HF breaks the trend by boiling *much* higher than expected because its strong H‑bonding outweighs its low electron count. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}"

      "summary": "Short alcohols form H‑bonds with water comparable in strength to water–water bonds, so mixing is favourable. As hydrocarbon chain length grows (or for polar but non‑H‑bonding halogenoalkanes) London forces within the solute outweigh any weak solute–water attractions, so solubility drops sharply. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}"

Non‑polar Br₂, for instance, is soluble in non‑polar hexane because both rely chiefly on London forces. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}"
