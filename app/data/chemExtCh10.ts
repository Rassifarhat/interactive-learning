      "summary": "Catlin's team used GC-MS to analyze the unknown steroid, deducing its molecular formula as C21H28O2 from accurate mass measurement. They compared its mass spectrum with known steroids, noting similarities with gestrinone and trenbolone. The unknown had fragments 4 Da higher than gestrinone, indicating it was a derivative with additional hydrogen atoms. They synthesized THG from gestrinone, confirming identity through matching retention time and mass spectra."
