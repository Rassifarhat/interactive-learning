This occurs due to the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of waves changes for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. In the context of the universe, when galaxies move away from us, the light they emit is red-shifted. This observation supports the idea of an expanding universe, as it indicates that galaxies are moving away from each other. Edwin Hubble's observations in the 1920s showed a correlation between the distance of galaxies and their red shift, leading to the conclusion that the universe is expanding uniformly. This expansion can be likened to a balloon being inflated, where points on the surface move away from each other as the balloon expands. The red shift provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory, suggesting that the universe began from a",
