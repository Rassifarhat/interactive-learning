Next, perform a more precise titration by adding approximately 20 cm³ of the alkali quickly to the acid in the conical flask while swirling to mix the solutions thoroughly. Subsequently, add the alkali dropwise until the indicator changes from its acidic color to its alkaline color, indicating that neutralization has occurred. This method allows for precise measurement of the alkali needed for neutralization, accurate to within one drop. It is important to note that while it is possible to add the acid to the alkali, observing the phenolphthalein indicator changing to pink when alkali is added is typically easier. When reading the burette, the levels of the liquid increase from top to bottom (0 cm³ at the top and 50 cm³ at the bottom).

Thus, the most precise determination of the neutralisation point we can achieve is to within one drop of the titrant. Various indicators can be used in titrations, such as methyl orange, but universal indicator should not be used because it has a range of colours and changes gradually between them, which would prevent a clear endpoint from being observed. To calculate the volume of alkali added during a titration, one must subtract the initial burette reading from the final burette reading, as demonstrated by the calculation: volume of alkali = final reading (23.85 cm³) - initial reading (2.10 cm³) = 21.75 cm³.",
