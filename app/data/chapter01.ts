Interconversions include melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), condensation (gas to liquid), evaporation (liquid to gas), and sublimation (solid to gas). These changes can be achieved by altering temperature or pressure, resulting in changes in particle arrangement, movement, and energy. For example, heating a solid provides energy, allowing particles to move apart and transition to a liquid state.",

Plot the temperature on the x-axis and the solubility (g/100 g solvent) on the y-axis. The resulting curve illustrates how solubility changes with temperature, indicating whether the solute is more or less soluble at higher temperatures.

In liquids, particles are also close together but can slide past one another, allowing liquids to take the shape of their container while maintaining a definite volume.

Gases have particles that are far apart and move freely, filling the entire volume of their container, making it easy to move through air. Additionally, when most solids are melted, their volume increases slightly, and most liquids are less dense than the solids they originate from. For instance, boiling about 5 cmÂ³ of water produces steam, which will occupy a much larger volume than the original water.",

These forces keep the particles packed closely together, and thus they cannot move out of your way. In solids, the particles are arranged regularly and are fixed in position, only able to vibrate, which prevents movement through them. In contrast, you can swim through water (a liquid) because the arrangement of its particles allows you to push them out of the way. In liquids, particles are mostly touching but can move around each other due to weaker forces of attraction. Additionally, it is easy to move through a gas, as gas particles are much further apart and there are almost no forces of attraction, allowing for free movement in all directions. The difference in particle arrangement and the strength of forces between solids, liquids, and gases explains why walking through a solid wall is impossible while moving through liquids and gases is feasible.",

Eventually, the particles slow down enough that the forces of attraction can hold them in a fixed position, packing them closely together to form a solid. This process is known as freezing, and the temperature at which this occurs is called the freezing point.

Condensation, on the other hand, is the process where gas molecules lose energy, typically by coming into contact with a cooler surface.

Fast-moving particles at the surface can break away, resulting in the liquid slowly disappearing when exposed to air. In a closed container, particles in the gas will collide with the surface particles of the liquid; those with lower speeds may be attracted back to the liquid, leading to both evaporation and condensation occurring simultaneously.",

In the context of ammonia gas in a laboratory, when ammonia is released, the particles are free to move around and will begin to spread out through the air. At room temperature, ammonia particles travel at speeds of about 600 metres per second; theoretically, they could travel from one end of the lab to the other in under 0.01 seconds if they did not collide with other particles. However, in reality, ammonia particles bounce off air particles, which causes the diffusion process to occur more slowly. As a result, although individual ammonia particles may cover distances of 30 kilometres or more during the time it takes for the smell to fill the lab, the overall spreading of the gas still takes some time due to these constant collisions. Therefore, diffusion is the reason the smell of ammonia gradually reaches everyone in the lab.",

Diluting this solution to a total volume of 10000 cmÂ³ still allows the purple color to be visible. This visibility depends on the presence of a sufficient number of 'particles' of potassium manganate(VII) in each drop of the solution. Since there are 200000 drops in 10000 cmÂ³, each drop must contain at least one 'particle' for the solution to retain its color. Therefore, there must be at least 200000 'particles' in the 0.01 g of potassium manganate(VII). This indicates that each 'particle' cannot weigh more than 50 billionths of a gram (0.00000005 g). However, the actual weight of a potassium manganate(VII) 'particle' is approximately 0.00000000000000000000026 g and there are, in fact, about 380000000000000000000 'particles' in 0.01 g. This demonstrates that a large number of 'particles' is necessary in each drop to make the color perceptible.",

The mass of the evaporating basin is 25.72 g, the mass of the evaporating basin plus solution is 58.00 g, and the mass of the evaporating basin plus dry crystals is 38.00 g. \n\n1. Calculate the mass of the dry crystals (solute): \n   Mass of crystals = Mass of evaporating basin + dry crystals - Mass of evaporating basin \n   = 38.00 g - 25.72 g = 12.28 g \n\n2.

The maximum mass of solid that dissolves in 20.00 g of water is 12.28 g. To find out how much would dissolve in 100 g of water, we multiply by 5 (since 100 g is 5 times 20 g): \n   Mass that would dissolve in 100 g of water = 12.28 g x 5 = 61.4 g \n\n4.
