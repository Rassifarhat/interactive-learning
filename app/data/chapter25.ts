          "summary": "Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). They undergo several key chemical reactions, including: 1. **Addition Reactions**: Alkenes readily participate in addition reactions due to the presence of the double bond. Common types of addition reactions include:   - **Hydrogenation**: The addition of hydrogen (H2) in the presence of a catalyst (usually palladium, platinum, or nickel) converts alkenes to alkanes. For example, ethene (C2H4) can be converted to ethane (C2H6).   - **Halogenation**: Alkenes react with halogens (Br2, Cl2) to form dihaloalkanes. For instance, ethene reacts with bromine to form 1,2-dibromoethane.   - **Hydrohalogenation**: The addition of hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr) across the double bond leads to the formation of haloalkanes. For example, ethene can react with HCl to yield chloroethane.   - **Hydration**: In the presence of water and an acid catalyst, alkenes can undergo hydration to form alcohols. For example, ethene reacting with water in the presence of H2SO4 can produce ethanol. 2. **Polymerization**: Alkenes can undergo polymerization where many monomer units of alkenes join together to form long-chain polymers. This reaction is significant in producing plastics, such as polyethylene from ethene. 3. **Oxidation**: Alkenes can be oxidized using strong oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or ozone (O3), producing alcohols or carbonyl compounds like ketones and aldehydes. 4. **Combustion**: Alkenes combust in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), releasing energy. The general equation is CnH2n + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Alkenes typically have higher reactivity than alkanes due to the double bond, which makes them more susceptible to chemical attack.",

For example, the alkene with 11 carbon atoms will have 22 hydrogen atoms and a molecular formula of C_{11}H_{22}.
