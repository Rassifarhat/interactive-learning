The significance of the number of electrons in the outer shell is critical; noble gases (except helium) have 8 electrons in their outer shell, which means they do not tend to lose, gain, or share electrons to form compounds. In contrast, atoms in other groups tend to form compounds by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons until they reach 8 electrons in their outer shell, following the octet rule. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties due to having the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which determines how they react.

They are shiny (have a metallic lustre) when polished or freshly cut, malleable (can be hammered into shape), ductile (can be drawn into wires), and are good conductors of electricity and heat. Metals form ionic compounds and positive ions in their compounds. Non-metals, on the other hand, tend to have low melting and boiling points, with some exceptions like carbon and silicon. Non-metals are usually brittle when solid, do not have the same type of shine as metals, and generally do not conduct electricity, except for exceptions like carbon (in graphite form) and silicon. They are poor conductors of heat, with diamond being the best conductor of heat among all elements. Non-metals form both ionic and covalent compounds, and tend to form negative ions in ionic compounds.",
