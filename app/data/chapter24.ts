The first four alkanes (C1 to C4) are gases at room temperature (–25°C), while the next members are liquids, with solids starting to appear around C18H38. The increase in boiling points is due to the increase in the size of the molecules, which leads to stronger intermolecular forces of attraction. As the molecules become larger, more energy is required to overcome these attractions, resulting in higher boiling points. Furthermore, members of a homologous series have similar chemical properties because they share the same functional groups and bonding structure. Alkanes, which only contain carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-hydrogen bonds, exhibit similar reactivity and are relatively unreactive because of the strength of these bonds, making them quite inert.",

These free radicals are very reactive and can interact with alkanes, which are typically unreactive. An example is the reaction between methane and bromine gas, which gives a color change from orange to colorless when exposed to sunlight, resulting in the formation of bromomethane and hydrogen bromide gases: CH₄(g) + Br₂(g) → CH₃Br(g) + HBr(g). A similar reaction occurs between ethane and chlorine to yield chloroethane and hydrogen chloride: C₂H₆(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₅Cl(g) + HCl(g). Mono-substitution occurs when only one hydrogen atom from the alkane is replaced by a halogen atom, leading to products called halogenoalkanes named in the format x-haloalkane, where 'x' indicates the position of the halogen on the carbon chain. For example, the mono-substitution of propane with bromine can yield two structural isomers, 1-bromopropane and 2-bromopropane, which have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas, demonstrating the significance of isomerism in substitution reactions.",
