Boiling point increases: larger molecules attract each other more strongly than smaller ones, necessitating more energy to overcome these stronger intermolecular forces and break them apart into gas. 2. The liquids become less volatile: the larger the hydrocarbon, the more slowly it evaporates at room temperature due to stronger interactions with neighboring molecules, making it harder to turn into gas. 3. The liquids become more viscous and flow less easily: smaller hydrocarbons are runny while larger ones are thicker because of the stronger intermolecular attractions. 4. The liquids become darker in color as the size of the hydrocarbon increases. 5. Bigger hydrocarbons do not burn as easily as smaller ones, which limits their use as fuels.",

The vapours rise up this column, with the boiling point of each hydrocarbon determining how far it travels. For instance, a hydrocarbon boiling at 120°C will remain as a gas at the higher temperatures at the bottom of the column, but as it ascends and the temperature decreases, it will condense into a liquid when it reaches 120°C and can then be collected. Smaller hydrocarbons have lower boiling points and will rise further up the column before condensing, while longer chain hydrocarbons with higher boiling points condense lower down the column. This process effectively separates the crude oil into various fractions. The refinery gas fraction consists of very small molecules with very low boiling points, so the column temperature never drops low enough for them to condense, remaining as gases. Conversely, some very large hydrocarbons do not boil due to insufficient temperature in the column, thus remaining liquid and are removed as a residue from the bottom.

The key reactions involved in the formation of acid rain are: \n\n1. Production of sulfur dioxide when fossil fuels are burned: \n   S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g) \n\n2. Conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid: \n   2 SO2(g) + 2 H2O(l) + O2(g) → 2 H2SO4(aq) \n   (Alternatively, weaker sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is formed when SO2 reacts with water: SO2(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO3(aq)) \n\n3. Formation of nitrogen oxides in petrol engines due to high temperatures: \n   N2(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO(g) \n   (These nitrogen oxides can be converted to nitric acid in the atmosphere, contributing to acid rain.)  \n\nThe effects of acid rain are devastating. It can kill trees and aquatic life by lowering the pH of lakes to levels that cannot support life.

          "summary": "Cracking is a method of thermal decomposition where larger hydrocarbon molecules are broken down into smaller ones upon heating. The fuel oil fraction is heated to produce a gas and then passed over a catalyst consisting of silicon dioxide (silica) and aluminium oxide (alumina) at a temperature of about 600-700°C. Cracking can also be done at higher temperatures without a catalyst, referred to as thermal cracking. During the process, primarily C-C single bonds in large molecules are broken to create new C=C double bonds, leading to a product mixture of alkanes and alkenes, including ethene, propene, and octane. The significance of cracking lies in two main reasons for oil companies: it enables the production of more petrol (gasoline), which is a critical fuel, and more alkenes, which are valuable for making polymers and other organic chemicals due to their higher reactivity compared to alkanes.",

          "summary": "Catalytic cracking is a process used to break down larger hydrocarbons into smaller, more useful hydrocarbons. This process involves various reactions where the larger hydrocarbon molecules might split in different ways, leading to the formation of smaller hydrocarbons including both alkanes and alkenes. For example, C13H28 can decompose to form products such as 2C2H4 and C8H20, or 2C2H4, C3H6, and C8H14. Additionally, some reactions may produce free hydrogen gas, as illustrated by the reaction where C13H28 also yields H2 gas as a byproduct. The products formed after the cracking will consist of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, and they all may contain double bonds if alkenes are present. After cracking, the resulting mixture undergoes further processing, including fractional distillation, to separate the individual compounds into pure substances.",

          "summary": "In industry, catalytic cracking involves passing hydrocarbons through a bed of zeolite (aluminosilicate) catalyst at approximately 500°C and moderate pressures. This process breaks down large straight-chain hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones. Additionally, isomerisation may occur during catalytic cracking, resulting in the production of branched-chain alkanes and alkanes with ring structures. The presence of these isomers enhances the octane number of the fuel, which indicates the fuel's ability to resist auto-ignition in an engine. Auto-ignition occurs when fuel burns spontaneously and uncontrollably, which can lead to engine wear and fuel wastage. A higher octane number corresponds to a lower tendency for the fuel to undergo auto-ignition, making it more efficient and reliable for engine use.",
