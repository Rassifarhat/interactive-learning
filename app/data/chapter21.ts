As blue squares are used up, their concentration decreases, resulting in a lower rate of conversion. Conversely, the yellow squares can revert back to blue squares, indicating the reaction is reversible.

For example, in a system where blue squares represent one reactant and yellow squares represent the product, the number of blue squares and yellow squares will stay the same, even though individual squares may change color back and forth. It is important to note that the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium are constant but are not necessarily equal. To achieve dynamic equilibrium, the system must be closed, meaning no substances can enter or leave the container. If, for instance, products are removed from the system as they form, the reverse reaction cannot occur, and the reaction will progress in one direction only. A classic example of a reversible reaction that reaches equilibrium is the decomposition of calcium carbonate, where the equation is: CaCO3(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO2(g). If this reaction occurs in an open container, CO2 will escape, preventing the reverse reaction from occurring, thereby inhibiting the establishment of equilibrium.",

For example, if the temperature is increased and the reaction reaches a new equilibrium state, the concentrations might change to 80% for A and 20% for B.

Additionally, strong acids and bases completely dissociate in solution, while weak acids and bases only partially dissociate.",

The double arrow ($\rightleftharpoons$) signifies that both the forward and reverse reactions can occur. \nb One observation associated with the forward reaction is the evolution of a gas (ammonia), which can be detected by its characteristic pungent smell when the solid ammonium chloride is heated. \nc The substances present in the reaction mixture at equilibrium are ammonium chloride (solid), ammonia (gas), and hydrogen chloride (gas).",
