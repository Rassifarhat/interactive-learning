As a result, the sodium atom loses an electron and becomes a positively charged ion, known as a cation (for example, Na+). Conversely, the chlorine atom gains an electron and becomes a negatively charged ion, known as an anion (for example, Cl-). The charged particles formed, called ions, exhibit strong electrostatic attraction, which is the basis of ionic bonding. This attraction occurs between the positively charged cations and negatively charged anions, resulting in the formation of an ionic compound. Ionic bonding can be represented using dot-and-cross diagrams, which illustrate the transfer of electrons from the metal to the non-metal.

          "summary": "To determine the formula of calcium chloride, we start with the ions involved: $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ (calcium ion) and $\text{Cl}^{-}$ (chloride ion). The charges of the ions are crossed over to find the formula, resulting in $\text{CaCl}_{2}$, since the charge of calcium (2) becomes the subscript for chloride, while the charge of chloride (1) is not explicitly written. It is important to note that we do not write a 1 in front of chloride. However, we have to be cautious when using this method, especially when the charges of the ions are the same. For example, in the case of calcium oxide, $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\text{O}^{2-}$ also have equal charges. Here, you can deduce that there will be 1 of each ion in the formula. Therefore, the formula for calcium oxide is $\text{CaO}$ and not $\text{Ca}^{2}\text{O}^{2}$, which would inaccurately imply the ratio is 2:2 instead of the 1:1 ratio indicated by the equal charges.",

It has a structure identical to that of sodium chloride (NaCl), which means it also forms a giant ionic lattice. In this lattice, each magnesium ion is surrounded by oxide ions, and each oxide ion is surrounded by magnesium ions. The significant difference between the two structures lies in the strength of the ionic bonds; magnesium oxide is held together by stronger electrostatic attractions due to the presence of 2+ ions attracting 2- ions, compared to sodium chloride, where 1+ ions attract 1- ions. As a result, the lattice structure in magnesium oxide is generally stronger and more stable than that of sodium chloride.",

The smaller size of these ions leads to stronger electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions because the closer proximity of the charges increases the force of attraction. However, the charge of the ions plays a more significant role. The $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion has a greater positive charge than the $\text{Na}^{+}$ ion, resulting in stronger attractions due to the higher charge density. Similarly, the $\text{O}^{2-}$ ion, with a greater negative charge than the $\text{Cl}^{-}$ ion, also leads to stronger attractions. Therefore, while ionic size is important, the charge of the ions is more critical in determining the strength of the attractions between them.",
