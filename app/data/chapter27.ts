These acids are capable of turning blue litmus paper red and will react with metal elements. For example, ethanoic acid, when diluted, reacts with metals in a manner similar to other dilute acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, though the reaction occurs more slowly. For instance, when dilute ethanoic acid reacts with magnesium, a significant amount of fizzing is observed, resulting in the production of a salt and hydrogen gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: \n$$\\mathrm{Mg} (\\mathrm{s}) + 2 \\mathrm{CH}_3 \\mathrm{COOH} (\\mathrm{aq}) \\rightarrow \\left(\\mathrm{CH}_3 \\mathrm{COO}\\right)_2 \\mathrm{Mg} (\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{H}_2 (\\mathrm{g})$$\nIn this reaction, the salt formed is magnesium ethanoate, which is soluble in water, leading to a colorless solution. It is also important to note that students often struggle with the formulae of salts such as magnesium ethanoate; this compound is an ionic compound where the cation is magnesium (Mg^2+) and the anion is the ethanoate ion (CH3COO^-).",

Thus, the metal is written after the ethanoate to reflect this structural interaction, requiring two ethanoate ions for each magnesium ion to achieve charge neutrality.",
