They typically involve non-metal elements and result in the formation of molecules. The main differences between covalent compounds and ionic compounds are: 1. Bonding: In covalent compounds, atoms share electrons, while in ionic compounds, electrons are transferred from one atom to another. 2. Structure: Covalent compounds can exist as discrete molecules (molecular covalent) or as extended networks (network covalent). Ionic compounds consist of a lattice structure composed of ions. 3. Properties: Covalent compounds generally have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds, which tend to be solid at room temperature and have higher melting and boiling points due to strong ionic bonds. 4. Electrical Conductivity: Covalent compounds do not conduct electricity in any state, while ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water due to the presence of free-moving ions.",

However, they can conduct electricity when they are molten or dissolved in water (aqueous solution) because the ions become free to move. In contrast, covalent molecular compounds, such as hexane (C6H14), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2), do not conduct electricity in any state or in solution. This is because they consist of individual molecules that do not carry an overall electrical charge, meaning there are no charged particles to move around. The electrons are tightly held in the atoms or in covalent bonds, preventing movement between molecules. An exception includes compounds that can form ions in water, such as ammonia, which reacts with water: NH3(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq). Ammonia solution can conduct electricity because it produces ions that are free to move. Another example is hydrogen chloride gas, which dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid (HCl(aq)). Hydrogen chloride ionizes in water: HCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq), allowing the solution to conduct electricity due to the presence of free-moving ions.",

When the heating stops and the lead(II) bromide solidifies, all activity ceases, the bulb goes out, and there is no more bubbling. The solid lead(II) bromide is an ionic compound composed of lead(II) ions (Pb^2+) and bromide ions (Br^-), arranged in a crystal lattice that does not conduct electricity when solid due to the immobility of the ions.

However, sodium is a very reactive metal, making it difficult to convert sodium ions back to sodium atoms by adding electrons. In contrast, hydrogen ions are less reactive, allowing electrons to add more easily to hydrogen ions to form hydrogen atoms. The half-equation for this reaction is:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}^{+}(\text{aq}) + 2 \text{e}^{-} \rightarrow \text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\n$$\n\nAdditionally, the hydrogen ions come from the ionization of water molecules, which also produces hydroxide ions.\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_{2} \text{O}(\text{l}) + 2 \text{e}^{-} \rightarrow \text{H}_{2}(\text{g}) + 2 \text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\n$$\n\nThis alternative half-equation shows that hydroxide ions are produced at the cathode, leading to an increase in alkalinity in the solution around the cathode.",

The reduction reaction at the cathode is given by: \n\n\bC\u0002+(aq) + 2 e\b \u0011 Cu(s) \n\nAs a result, the cathode is coated with pink-brown copper. At the anode, sulfate ions (SO4^2-) and hydroxide ions (OH^-) from the water are attracted. Sulfate ions are not easily oxidized, so oxygen is produced instead from the oxidation of hydroxide ions. The oxidation reaction can be expressed as: \n\n4 OH^-(aq) \u0011 2 H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4 e\b \n\nAlternatively, this reaction can also be represented as: \n\n2 H2O(l) \u0011 O2(g) + 4 H^+(aq) + 4 e\b \n\nThis second equation illustrates why the solution turns acidic, as hydrogen ions (H^+) are produced. If electrolysis continues long enough, all the copper(II) ions will be consumed, causing the blue color of the solution to fade and ultimately become colorless. The original ions present in the solution were Cu^2+, SO4^2-, H^+, and OH^-. However, during the electrolysis, copper ions and hydroxide ions are discharged at the electrodes while hydrogen ions and sulfate ions remain in the solution, which turns into dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
