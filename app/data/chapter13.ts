Introduce a substance that reacts with oxygen, such as a burning splint or iron filings. 3. Measure the initial volume of air. 4. As the reaction occurs, the volume of air decreases due to the consumption of oxygen. 5. Measure the final volume of air after the reaction is complete. 6. Calculate the decrease in volume, which corresponds to the volume of oxygen consumed. 7. The percentage of oxygen in the air can then be determined using the formula: (volume of oxygen consumed / initial volume of air) x 100%. This shows that air contains about one-fifth oxygen.",

Mark the position of the bung on the conical flask and fill it with water only to that point, thus calculating the volume of air in the conical flask as 130 cm³, and in the connecting tube as 12 cm³, leading to an initial total volume of air of 234 cm³ (130 + 12 + 92 [initial reading on gas syringe]). \n4. Add wet iron filings to the conical flask. \n5. Record the initial reading on the gas syringe, which is 92 cm³. \n6. Leave the apparatus in place for about a week until the reading on the gas syringe stops changing. \n7. Record the final reading on the gas syringe, which is 43 cm³. \n8.

CO2 is considered a greenhouse gas, which contributes to the greenhouse effect: high-energy ultraviolet (UV) and visible light from the sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere, warming the surface. The surface then emits infrared (IR) radiation, which is absorbed by CO2 molecules, causing them to re-radiate this energy in all directions, further heating the atmosphere. Over the last 200 years, CO2 levels have been increasing, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This rise in CO2 is believed to contribute to climate change, which may result in consequences such as melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather patterns (including floods, droughts, and heatwaves). However, there are opposing views that argue these temperature increases during the 20th century are part of natural heating and cooling cycles influenced by the sun and ocean currents, downplaying the role of CO2. These skeptics believe that the effect of carbon dioxide on climate change is minimal compared to these natural factors.",

          "summary": "CO2 is a greenhouse gas because it can absorb infrared (IR) radiation emitted by the surface of the Earth and then emit it again in all directions, which warms the atmosphere. A molecule must vibrate in such a way that it causes a change in polarity to absorb IR radiation. CO2, although a non-polar molecule in its linear and symmetrical form, becomes non-symmetrical and polar as it vibrates, allowing it to absorb IR radiation. In contrast, O2 and N2 are non-polar molecules because both atoms are the same and attract electrons in covalent bonds equally, resulting in no small charges. O2 and N2 can only vibrate in one way, maintaining their non-polarity; thus, there is no change in polarity during vibration, preventing them from absorbing IR radiation and making them non-greenhouse gases.",
