Although the hydrogen atoms do not turn into helium, they effectively attain a stable state through shared electrons. This principle is consistent for most molecules, where non-hydrogen atoms aim to have 8 electrons in their outer shells, aligning with the octet rule. The outer atoms, typically bonded to a central atom (as seen in CH4 or PCl4), will have 8 electrons in their outer shells or 2 if they are hydrogen atoms. It is rare to find examples where these outer atoms do not have 8 electrons, although there are some instances where the central atom may not fulfill the octet requirement.

For example, when you hold a book and let it fall, the book moves towards a position of lower potential energy on the floor, making it more stable. Similarly, in covalent bonding, such as in hydrogen chloride (HCl), when atoms form bonds, energy is released. This release of energy indicates that the HCl molecule has less energy compared to its constituent atoms (H and Cl), thus making it a more stable entity. In diagrams representing covalent bonds, like those for HCl, the shared pair of electrons is depicted, illustrating how the bond forms and contributes to the overall stability of the molecule.",

          "summary": "C60 fullerene has several distinct properties that set it apart from diamond and graphite. Firstly, unlike diamond and graphite, C60 fullerene can dissolve in some solvents because it involves breaking only relatively weak intermolecular forces of attraction, rather than the strong covalent bonds found in diamond. This makes it less hard than diamond; it requires less energy to break the intermolecular forces in C60 fullerene compared to the strong covalent bonds in diamond. Additionally, C60 fullerene does not conduct electricity. Although each carbon atom in C60 forms three bonds, the fourth electron is confined within each C60 molecule and cannot travel between molecules, unlike in graphite where electrons can move freely between layers, allowing for electrical conductivity.",
