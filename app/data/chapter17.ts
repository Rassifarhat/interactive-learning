The reaction is represented as: \u000001NH3(aq) + \u0001H2O(l) \u000001 \u000001NH4\u0000B9(aq) + \u0001OH\u0000B9(aq). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates in aqueous solution to produce hydrogen ions (\u000001H\u0000B9) and chloride ions (\u0001Cl\u0000B9) according to the equation: HCl(aq) \u000001 \u000001H\u0000B9(aq) + \u0001Cl\u0000B9(aq). The overall reaction involves the combination of these ions to form water: \u0001H\u0000B9(aq) + \u0001OH\u0000B9(aq) \u000001 \u000001H2O(l). Furthermore, when ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases react, they produce solid ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which can be observed as white smoke: \u0001NH3(g) + HCl(g) \u000001 \u000001NH4Cl(s). In addition to the Arrhenius theory, the Br\u0000B8nsted-Lowry theory offers a broader understanding, classifying an acid as a proton (H\u0000B9) donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water, the better representation of the reaction is: \u0001H2O(l) + HCl(aq) \u0001 \u0001H3O\u0000B9(aq) + \u0001Cl\u0000B9(aq), where HCl donates a proton to the water molecule, identifying HCl as the acid and H2O as the base. The \u0001H3O\u0000B9 ion is called the hydroxonium ion, commonly represented as \u0001H\u0000B9(aq). The presence of \u0001Cl\u0000B9 results from the proton transfer, where the \u0001H\u0000B9 leaves an electron with the water molecule.",
