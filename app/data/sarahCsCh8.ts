Additionally, a disk repair utility program, which can be a component of a disk formatter, performs disk contents analysis and disk repair when necessary. It first checks for errors on the disk, which may arise from physical defects resulting in bad sectors, often caused during manufacture or from mishandling, such as moving the computer without securing the disk heads. Other errors can occur from sudden events like power loss or system shutdown, leading to unusable files. The disk repair utility can mark bad sectors to prevent the file system from using them, and may be able to recover some data if file integrity has been affected; otherwise, it may have to delete the corrupted files.",

This utility is not primarily concerned with errors but improves the efficiency of a functioning disk that becomes less efficient over time due to the logical arrangement of data in sectors. The constant creation, editing, and deletion of files leads to fragmentation, as files cannot always be stored as a single block of data. For example, when a file (File A) occupies multiple sectors, and a smaller file (File B) is deleted, the space left by File B remains unfilled, leading to fragmentation. When File A is extended, it fills available sectors but may not utilize fragmented spaces optimally, resulting in inefficient disk usage. The defragmentation process arranges data into contiguous segments, but is time-consuming for large disks and may be impossible if the disk lacks sufficient free space for rearrangement.",

However, this ideal state can never be realised due to the emergence of new viruses.

The major benefits include the ability to use tried and tested functions, which saves time and reduces errors in newly developed programs. Examples of library routines are built-in functions of programming languages and collections like the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) library, which has been developing reliable routines since 1971. Including library routines can increase storage space requirements due to each program needing its own copy. An alternative is to use dynamic linked libraries (DLL) where a small piece of code links to routines stored separately in memory, minimizing storage and memory requirements. However, reliance on DLLs can pose risks if they become corrupted or have undiscovered bugs, potentially causing programs to fail or produce errors.",
