Question,Answer
What defines an organic compound?,"Organic compounds contain carbon atoms and usually hydrogen, often forming long chains or rings."
What is a hydrocarbon?,A compound made only of hydrogen and carbon.
What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons?,Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds; unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond.
What is the simplest hydrocarbon?,Methane (CH₄)
What are alkanes and cycloalkanes?,Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds; cycloalkanes are ring versions of alkanes.
What are the four types of formula used in organic chemistry?,"Empirical, molecular, structural, and displayed formulae."
What is the difference between structural and displayed formula?,Structural formula shows minimal bonds; displayed shows all bonds between atoms.
What is a skeletal formula?,A simplified organic formula showing carbon skeleton and functional groups only.
What is a homologous series?,A family of compounds with the same functional group and general formula.
What is the general formula for alkanes?,CₙH₂ₙ₊₂
What is a functional group?,An atom or group of atoms responsible for the chemical reactions of a molecule.
What is the complete combustion equation for methane?,CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
What is the trend in boiling points for straight-chain alkanes?,Boiling point increases with increasing number of carbon atoms.
What is IUPAC nomenclature?,A systematic method of naming organic chemical compounds.
What does the prefix 'meth-' signify in organic chemistry?,One carbon atom.
What does the prefix 'eth-' signify?,Two carbon atoms.
How is the longest carbon chain identified in a compound?,Choose the chain with the most carbon atoms including the functional group.
What is structural isomerism?,Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae.
What are chain isomers?,Isomers differing by the arrangement of the carbon chain.
What are position isomers?,Isomers where the functional group is in different positions on the same carbon skeleton.
What is a substitution reaction?,A reaction where one atom or group in a molecule is replaced by another.
What is a free radical?,"A species with an unpaired electron, highly reactive."
What happens in the chlorination of methane?,CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl under UV light via free radical substitution.
What are the three steps in free radical substitution?,"Initiation, propagation, and termination."
What is a catalytic converter used for?,"It converts harmful gases like CO and NOₓ into less harmful substances using catalysts like Pt, Rh."
What is cracking?,"Breaking large hydrocarbons into smaller, more useful ones."
What are the conditions for catalytic cracking?,High temperature (~450°C) and a zeolite catalyst.
What is reforming in petrochemistry?,Converting straight-chain alkanes to branched or cyclic alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons.
What are pollutants from alkane combustion?,"CO, CO₂, NOₓ, SO₂, carbon particulates, unburned hydrocarbons."
What are biofuels?,"Fuels derived from biological material such as plants (e.g., bioethanol, biodiesel)."
What is the benefit of biofuels over fossil fuels?,They can be carbon-neutral and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
What are the limitations of biofuels?,Land use for food crops is compromised; may not be entirely carbon-neutral.
What does carbon-neutral mean?,CO₂ absorbed during growth equals CO₂ emitted on combustion.
What are the two key features of alkanes in fuel use?,They are readily combustible and release energy.
What is polymerisation?,A reaction where many small molecules (monomers) join to form a large molecule (polymer).
What is the environmental concern with polymers?,They are non-biodegradable and contribute to waste.
What is the importance of empirical and molecular formulas?,"Empirical shows the simplest ratio, molecular gives actual number of atoms in the molecule."
