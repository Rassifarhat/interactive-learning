"1. Explain the primary purpose of using pseudocode before writing code in a specific programming language.,"Pseudocode serves as a blueprint for an algorithm, outlining the steps in a clear and human-readable format before the complexities of specific programming language syntax are introduced. This helps in planning the logic and structure of the program."
"2. What is the significance of indentation in Python, and how does it differ from its role in VB.NET and Java?","In Python, indentation is syntactically significant and defines code blocks for control structures. In VB.NET and Java, indentation is primarily for readability; code blocks are defined by keywords (End If) or braces ({})."
"3. Describe the difference between a variable and a constant, and provide an example of how each is declared in pseudocode.","A variable is a named storage location whose value can change (e.g., DECLARE Counter : INTEGER). A constant holds a fixed value that cannot be altered (e.g., CONSTANT PI = 3.14)."
4. Evaluate the pseudocode expression: 10 MOD 3 * 2 + 5 DIV 2. Show the order of operations.,10 MOD 3 = 1; 1 * 2 = 2; 5 DIV 2 = 2; then 2 + 2 = 4.
"5. Explain the difference between Console.WriteLine() and Console.Write() in VB.NET, and provide a scenario where each would be useful.","Console.WriteLine() outputs text and adds a newline thereafter (e.g., logging messages line by line). Console.Write() outputs text without a newline, allowing subsequent output on the same line (e.g., prompting the user inline)."
6. Why might you need to convert user input from a string to a different data type in Python? Provide an example.,"Python's input() function returns a string, so to perform numerical operations you must convert it (e.g., age_str = input(""Enter age: ""); age = int(age_str))."
7. Describe the difference between an IF...THEN...ELSE statement and a nested IF statement. When might you use each?,An IF...THEN...ELSE selects between two branches based on one condition. A nested IF places one IF inside another to handle multiple conditions sequentially. Use nested IFs for multi-level decision making.
8. Explain the fundamental difference between a WHILE loop and a REPEAT...UNTIL loop in terms of when their conditions are checked.,"A WHILE loop checks its condition before each iteration (may execute zero times). A REPEAT...UNTIL loop checks after each iteration, guaranteeing at least one execution."
9. Give an example of how you would extract the first three characters of a string variable named MyString in Python using slicing.,substring = MyString[0:3]
"10. What is the key difference between a procedure and a function in programming, particularly concerning return values?","A function returns a value to the caller, whereas a procedure performs actions without returning a value."
"Discuss the principles of recursion and iteration in algorithm design. Provide examples of problems best suited for each approach.","Recursion solves problems by breaking them into smaller instances of the same problem, using function calls to itself (e.g., factorial, tree traversal). Iteration uses loops to repeat instructions (e.g., summing array elements). Recursion is elegant for divide-and-conquer tasks; iteration is efficient for repetitive, linear processes."
"Compare and contrast the characteristics of depth-first and breadth-first search strategies in traversing data structures. Provide examples where each is preferable.","Depth-first search explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, using a stack or recursion. Breadth-first search explores all neighbors at each level before moving deeper, using a queue. DFS is memory-efficient for deep trees; BFS is best for finding shortest paths in graphs."
