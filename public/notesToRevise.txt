# Bond Polarity Role
Bond polarity influences the type of mechanism:

1. Non-polar or slightly polar bonds favor homolytic fission
2. Polar bonds favor heterolytic fission

# Thick-Client
A thick-client (also called a fat-client or rich-client) has more processing power and capabilities than a thin-client. It:

- Chooses an application provided by the server
- May perform processing before sending data to the server and after receiving output
- Can download applications from the server to run locally

Thick-clients reduce the processing load on servers and can function with intermittent network connectivity.

# Hexadecimal Conversions
Converting hexadecimal to binary: Each hex digit converts to 4 bits
0 → 0000, 1 → 0001, ..., 9 → 1001, A → 1010, B → 1011, ..., F → 1111

Converting binary to hexadecimal: Group bits into sets of 4, starting from the right, and convert each group to a hex digit.

Example: Binary 1011 0101 to hex: 1011 = B, 0101 = 5, so the result is B5

# Types of Numbers
Different types of numbers in computing include:

- Integer: A whole number used for counting (e.g., 3, 47)
- Signed integer: An integer with a sign (e.g., -3, +47)
- Fraction: Values represented as ratios (e.g., 2/3, 52/17)
- Mixed numbers: Numbers with whole and fractional parts (e.g., -37.85, 2.83)
- Exponential notation: Numbers expressed as powers (e.g., 3.6×10⁸, 4.2×10⁻⁹)
