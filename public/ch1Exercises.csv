"4. Write the simplest ionic equation, including state symbols, for: (a) the test for a sulfate and (b) the test for a chloride.","(a) SO₄²⁻(aq) + Ba²⁺(aq) → BaSO₄(s); (b) Cl⁻(aq) + Ag⁺(aq) → AgCl(s)"
"5. Gold Analysis Problem – A gold sovereign is analyzed using a multi‐step procedure (reaction with nitric acid in a fume cupboard, dilution, titration of a 25 cm³ aliquot with 0.050 mol dm⁻³ Na₂S₂O₃, recording titration volumes, etc.). The tasks are: (a) Explain why step 1 must be done in a fume cupboard, (b) complete the titration results table and calculate a suitable mean titre, (c) calculate the percentage uncertainty for titre 3, (d) match given equations to the reactions in the procedure, (e) decide whether the sovereign is genuine using calculations, and (f) list the assumptions made.","a) Step 1 is conducted in a fume cupboard because toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is produced. b) The recorded titration data (final volumes 26.00, 26.35, 25.90, 25.85 cm³; initial volumes 0.00, 0.55, 0.00, 0.00 cm³) give titres of 26.00, 25.80, 25.90, and 25.85 cm³ with a mean titre (excluding the initial rough titration) of 25.85 cm³. c) The total uncertainty is ±0.16 cm³, so the percentage uncertainty in titre 3 is (0.16/25.90)×100% ≈ 0.62%. d) The matched equations are: (i) Cu(s) + 4H⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2NO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) (dissolution of copper), (ii) 2Cu²⁺(aq) + 4I⁻(aq) → 2CuI(s) + I₂(aq) (reaction with iodide), and (iii) 2S₂O₃²⁻(aq) + I₂(aq) → 2I⁻(aq) + S₄O₆²⁻(aq) (titration reaction). e) Calculations show that the copper present is 0.821 g (from titration) which exceeds the expected 0.666 g, so the sovereign is likely not genuine. f) Assumptions include: complete dissolution of copper, gold’s non-reactivity with nitric acid, no loss of solution during transfers, completion of reactions, accurate measurements, and absence of contamination."
"6. Phosphorus Chlorides – Phosphorus forms three chlorides: PCl₃, PCl₅, and P₂Cl₄. The tasks are: (a) Define a molecular formula, (b) write an equation (no state symbols) for preparing PCl₅ by reacting white phosphorus (P₄) with chlorine gas, (c) write an equation (including state symbols) for the reaction of PCl₅ with water to produce H₃PO₄ and HCl, and (d) given a compound with 30.39% P and 69.61% Cl by mass, (i) identify the chloride and (ii) give its systematic name.","a) A molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule. b) P₄ + 10Cl₂ → 4PCl₅. c) PCl₅(s) + 4H₂O(l) → H₃PO₄(aq) + 5HCl(aq). d) Analysis of the mass percentages indicates that the chloride is P₂Cl₄, whose systematic name is diphosphorus tetrachloride."
"7. Metal Identification – A Group 2 metal sample (mass = 0.24 g) reacts with dilute HCl (M(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MCl₂(aq) + H₂(g)) and produces 230 cm³ of H₂. Tasks: (a) Calculate the metal's molar mass and suggest its identity with justification, and (b) identify the major procedural error and suggest a modification.","a) The moles of H₂ produced are 0.230 dm³ ÷ 24.0 dm³ mol⁻¹ ≈ 9.583×10⁻³ mol, giving a molar mass = 0.24 g ÷ 9.583×10⁻³ mol ≈ 25.0 g/mol. This is closest to magnesium (Mg, 24.3 g/mol). b) The error is that gas collection started before adding acid (the bung was removed), allowing hydrogen to escape. A better method is to add the acid via a side-arm or syringe (without removing the bung) or use a gas syringe."
"8. Sodium Azide Problem – Given the decomposition reaction 2NaN₃(s) → 2Na(l) + 3N₂(g), and further reactions of the produced Na, the tasks are: (a) Find the volume of gas (at r.t.p.) produced from one mole of NaN₃, and (b) (i) calculate the mass of sodium obtained from the decomposition of 3.25 g of NaN₃, and (ii) determine the concentration (in mol dm⁻³) of NaOH formed when this Na reacts with water to yield 25.0 cm³ of aqueous NaOH.","a) One mole of NaN₃ produces 3/2 mol N₂, which occupies (3/2)×24 dm³ = 36 dm³ at r.t.p. b) i) 3.25 g NaN₃ (molar mass 65.0 g/mol) corresponds to 0.0500 mol; thus, 0.0500 mol Na is produced, which has a mass of 0.0500 mol × 23.0 g/mol = 1.15 g. ii) Since 1 mol Na gives 1 mol NaOH, 0.0500 mol NaOH is formed; its concentration is 0.0500 mol ÷ (25.0×10⁻³ dm³) = 2.00 mol/dm³."
