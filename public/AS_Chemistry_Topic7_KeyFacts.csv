"37. Define intermolecular forces and explain why they are generally weaker than intramolecular forces.","Intermolecular forces are the attractive forces that exist between separate molecules. They are weaker than intramolecular forces (such as covalent bonds) because they rely on relatively weak electrostatic attractions between partial charges or temporary dipoles, rather than the sharing or transfer of electrons."
"38. Describe London dispersion forces and explain what factors influence their strength.","London dispersion forces are temporary attractive forces that arise when electrons within an atom or molecule momentarily accumulate in a way that creates an instantaneous dipole. Their strength increases with the molecule’s size, surface area, and number of electrons."
"39. Explain the origin of dipole-dipole interactions and provide an example of a molecule that exhibits these forces.","Dipole-dipole interactions occur between polar molecules that have a permanent separation of charge, resulting in a positive end and a negative end. For example, hydrogen chloride (HCl) exhibits dipole-dipole interactions."
"40. What is a hydrogen bond? Identify the specific conditions necessary for hydrogen bonding to occur between molecules.","A hydrogen bond is a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole interaction. It occurs when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) is attracted to another electronegative atom in a nearby molecule."
"41. How does hydrogen bonding contribute to the unique properties of water? Provide at least two specific examples.","Hydrogen bonding in water leads to its unusually high boiling point and the expansion that occurs upon freezing (resulting in ice that is less dense than liquid water). These strong interactions between water molecules make water an excellent solvent and impart high surface tension."
"42. Explain the relationship between the strength of intermolecular forces and the boiling point of a substance.","Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome. Therefore, substances with stronger intermolecular attractions have higher boiling points because more heat is needed to separate the molecules into the gas phase."
"43. How do intermolecular forces influence the viscosity of a liquid? Explain your reasoning.","Stronger intermolecular forces increase a liquid’s viscosity because the attractive forces between the molecules create greater resistance to flow. The stronger the attractions, the more energy is required for the molecules to slide past each other."
"44. Define surface tension and explain how intermolecular forces contribute to this phenomenon.","Surface tension is the tendency of a liquid's surface to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. It is caused by cohesive forces between the liquid molecules, where those at the surface experience a net inward pull due to stronger attractions with the molecules below."
"45. Explain the process of capillary action in terms of intermolecular forces, specifically mentioning adhesive and cohesive forces.","Capillary action occurs when adhesive forces between the liquid and a surface are stronger than the cohesive forces within the liquid. This results in the liquid rising in narrow spaces, as seen when water climbs the walls of a thin tube."
"46. How do the types and strengths of intermolecular forces affect the solubility of one substance in another?","Solubility is influenced by the similarity of intermolecular forces. Substances with similar types and strengths of intermolecular forces (for example, polar solutes in polar solvents or nonpolar solutes in nonpolar solvents) tend to be more soluble in each other, following the principle that 'like dissolves like.'"
"47. What are intermolecular forces and why are they important?","Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the attractions between molecules. They are important because they significantly influence physical properties such as boiling and melting points, viscosity, surface tension, and solubility, thereby affecting the state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) at various temperatures."
"48. What are the different types of intermolecular forces?","The main types of intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonds. London forces are present in all molecules, dipole-dipole interactions occur between polar molecules, and hydrogen bonds are strong dipole-dipole interactions that occur when hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine."
"49. How do intermolecular forces affect the boiling points of substances?","Substances with stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to separate the molecules into a gas, resulting in higher boiling points. For instance, molecules that exhibit hydrogen bonding have higher boiling points than those that only have dipole-dipole or London dispersion forces."
"50. How do intermolecular forces affect the solubility of substances?","Solubility is determined by the compatibility of intermolecular forces between the solute and the solvent. Polar substances tend to dissolve in polar solvents, and nonpolar substances dissolve in nonpolar solvents, because similar intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole interactions or London dispersion forces) facilitate mixing."
"51. What role do hydrogen bonds play in biological systems?","Hydrogen bonds are crucial in biological systems. They stabilize the structure of DNA by holding the two strands together and are vital for protein folding. Additionally, the hydrogen bonding network in water gives it a high boiling point and surface tension, making it an excellent solvent for biological molecules."
"52. How does the size and shape of molecules affect intermolecular forces?","The size and shape of a molecule determine the strength of London dispersion forces. Larger molecules with more electrons and greater surface areas have stronger dispersion forces due to increased polarizability, while more compact molecules experience weaker attractions."
"53. How do intermolecular forces explain phenomena like capillary action?","Capillary action is explained by the balance between cohesive forces among liquid molecules and adhesive forces between the liquid and a surface. When adhesive forces are stronger, the liquid climbs the walls of a capillary tube, overcoming gravity."
"54. How does the polarity of a molecule influence its intermolecular forces?","A molecule’s polarity, determined by differences in electronegativity and molecular geometry, leads to permanent dipole-dipole interactions. Polar molecules engage in stronger intermolecular forces (and hydrogen bonding if they contain O-H, N-H, or F-H bonds) compared to nonpolar molecules, which rely solely on London dispersion forces."
