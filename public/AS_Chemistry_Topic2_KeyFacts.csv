Question,Answer
What are the charges and masses of subatomic particles?,"Proton: +1, mass 1; Neutron: 0, mass 1; Electron: -1, mass ~0"
Where are the subatomic particles located?,Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus; electrons are in shells around the nucleus
What is an isotope?,Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons
Do isotopes have different chemical properties?,"No, because they have identical electronic configurations"
What is relative atomic mass (Aᵣ)?,The weighted average mass of atoms of an element relative to 1/12th of a carbon-12 atom
What is relative isotopic mass?,Mass of an isotope compared to 1/12th of a carbon-12 atom
How is relative atomic mass calculated from mass spectrometry data?,Σ(isotopic mass × relative abundance) / 100
What does a mass spectrometer detect?,It detects ions and separates them by mass-to-charge ratio
What is the M peak in a mass spectrum?,"The peak with the highest m/z ratio, showing the relative molecular mass"
How is the relative molecular mass of Cl₂ calculated?,"Using isotope ratio 9:6:1 from peaks at m/z = 70, 72, and 74"
What is an orbital?,A region of space where there is a high probability of finding an electron
How many electrons can an orbital hold?,Each orbital holds 2 electrons with opposite spins
"What are the s, p, and d orbitals?",s is spherical; p has 3 dumbbell-shaped orbitals; d has 5 more complex shapes
"How many electrons fit in s, p, d sub-shells?","s: 2, p: 6, d: 10"
What is the electron configuration of sodium (Z=11)?,1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹
What is the Pauli Exclusion Principle?,Two electrons in an orbital must have opposite spins
What is Hund’s Rule?,Electrons fill orbitals singly before pairing
What is ionisation energy?,The energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms
Is ionisation energy endothermic or exothermic?,Always endothermic
What 3 factors affect ionisation energy?,"Nuclear charge, atomic radius, electron shielding"
What is the trend in ionisation energy across a period?,Generally increases due to increasing nuclear charge
What is the trend in ionisation energy down a group?,Decreases due to increased shielding and atomic radius
Why is the second ionisation energy higher than the first?,Electron is removed from a more positively charged ion and often a closer shell
Why does ionisation energy drop between groups 2 and 3?,"Electron enters a p orbital, which is higher in energy and more shielded"
Why does ionisation energy drop between groups 5 and 6?,"Electron pairing occurs in the p orbital, causing repulsion"
What is the trend in atomic radius across a period?,Decreases due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons closer
What is the trend in atomic radius down a group?,Increases due to added shells and increased shielding
How are melting and boiling points affected across a period?,"In Period 2 and 3, they vary due to type of bonding and structure (metallic, covalent)"
What block are transition elements in?,d-block
What determines the block of an element?,"The sub-shell being filled (s, p, d)"
What is the electronic configuration of potassium (Z=19)?,1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s¹
Which orbital fills first: 3d or 4s?,4s fills before 3d
What is the definition of first ionisation energy?,Energy to remove one electron from each atom in 1 mole of gaseous atoms
Which element has the highest first ionisation energy?,Helium
Why do isotopes have the same chemical properties?,They have the same number and arrangement of electrons
Why is there a large jump in successive ionisation energies?,It occurs when removing an electron from a new shell closer to the nucleus
How many orbitals are in the 2p sub-shell?,"Three: 2px, 2py, 2pz"
