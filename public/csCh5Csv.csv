Discuss the fundamental principles of the von Neumann architecture and explain how the interaction between the CPU and memory enables the execution of a stored program. Consider the limitations of this architecture and how modern processors attempt to mitigate them.,"The von Neumann architecture is based on the concept of a stored program: both instructions and data reside in the same memory. The CPU fetches instructions sequentially from memory via the address and data buses, decodes them in the control unit, and executes them in the ALU. This unified memory simplifies design but creates the ‘von Neumann bottleneck’: the single bus limits throughput between CPU and memory. Modern processors mitigate this with caches (to reduce memory access), separate instruction/data caches (Harvard-like), wider buses, and techniques such as pipelining and parallelism to overlap instruction fetch, decode, and execute stages."
"Critically analyze the roles of the different components within the Central Processing Unit (CPU), including the Arithmetic Logic Unit, the Control Unit, and the various special-purpose registers. Explain how these components work together during the fetch-execute cycle to process instructions.","The CPU contains the ALU, which performs arithmetic and logical operations; the Control Unit, which orchestrates data flow and timing using the system clock; and registers like the PC (holds next instruction address), MAR (holds memory address), MDR (buffers data), CIR (holds current instruction), IX (for indexed addressing), and SR (stores status flags). During each fetch-execute cycle, the PC’s value is loaded into MAR, the instruction is fetched into MDR, moved to CIR, decoded by the Control Unit, and then executed by the ALU using data from registers or memory. The SR is updated based on ALU results, and the PC is updated for the next cycle."
"Explain the purpose and functionality of the three main components of the system bus: the address bus, the data bus, and the control bus. Discuss how the width of the address and data buses can impact the overall performance of a computer system.","The address bus is a unidirectional set of lines used to send memory or I/O addresses from the CPU’s MAR to memory or controllers. Its width determines the maximum directly addressable memory (e.g., 32 lines address 2^32 locations). The data bus is bidirectional, carrying instructions, addresses, or data between the CPU (MDR), memory, and I/O. A wider data bus allows larger data transfers per cycle, improving throughput. The control bus carries control and timing signals (e.g., read/write, interrupt requests) between the Control Unit and other components, synchronizing operations. Narrow buses can become performance bottlenecks by requiring multiple cycles for single transfers."
"Evaluate the significance of factors such as processor clock speed, cache memory, and word length in determining the overall performance of a computer system. Discuss the trade-offs and interdependencies between these factors in modern computer design.","Clock speed defines how many cycles per second the CPU can perform; higher speeds increase instruction throughput but raise power consumption and heat. Cache memory—located on or near the CPU—reduces latency by storing frequently accessed data; larger or multi-level caches improve performance but increase die area and cost. Word length (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit) affects how much data the CPU can process per cycle and the size of registers and buses; wider words boost performance on large data but require wider buses and more complex hardware. Designers balance these factors—high clock speeds with efficient cooling, optimal cache sizes within power and area budgets, and word lengths matching application needs—to achieve desired performance within cost and power constraints."
"Describe the fetch-execute cycle in detail, outlining each stage and the role of the key registers involved (Program Counter, Memory Address Register, Memory Data Register, Current Instruction Register). Furthermore, explain how interrupts are handled within this cycle and why interrupt handling is essential for efficient system operation.","In the fetch stage, the PC’s content is copied to MAR, the PC is incremented, and the instruction at that address is fetched into MDR. Then MDR → CIR transfers the instruction for decoding. In the decode stage, the instruction in CIR is interpreted by the Control Unit, which sets up signals for execution. In the execute stage, the ALU performs the required operation, using data from registers or memory. Interrupts are checked at the end of the execute stage; if an interrupt is pending, the CPU saves the PC and relevant registers to memory, loads the ISR address into PC, and executes the interrupt handler. After handling, saved state is restored, and normal execution resumes. Interrupts allow the CPU to respond promptly to I/O or exceptional events without polling, improving efficiency."
