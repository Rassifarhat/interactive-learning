"What is the primary purpose of a monitoring system, and give a specific example of its use?","A monitoring system primarily creates a record of a system's condition over time and detects when a physical property goes outside desired ranges; for example, it can alert when a CPU's temperature exceeds a safe limit."
Explain the function of a sensor in a computer-based monitoring system. Why is it said that a sensor has no built-in intelligence?,A sensor measures a physical property and transmits the corresponding signal to a computer for processing. It has no built-in intelligence because it only provides raw data and cannot interpret or act on that data independently.
Describe the key difference between a monitoring system and a control system. What additional component is essential for a system to be considered a control system?,"A monitoring system observes and records data, whereas a control system can also influence the system based on that data. An actuator is essential for a system to perform control actions."
"What is an actuator, and what is its typical role in a monitoring and control system? Provide an example of an actuator's function.","An actuator is a device, often an electric motor, that implements control actions by switching components on/off or adjusting settings. For example, it might adjust coolant flow to manage CPU temperature."
Explain the concept of feedback in a control system and why it is considered essential.,Feedback involves measuring the effect of control actions and using that information to make further adjustments. It is essential because it enables the system to self-correct and maintain desired conditions.
"What is a closed-loop feedback control system, and how does it utilize sensor data to regulate a system?",A closed-loop feedback control system compares actual output (from sensors) with the desired output and adjusts the actuator based on the difference to minimize error and maintain control.
Why do monitoring and control systems typically require real-time programming?,They need to continuously monitor sensor inputs and respond within strict time constraints to ensure timely detection and correction of deviations in system conditions.
Explain how Boolean variables and flags can be used in a monitoring and control program to represent system conditions.,"Boolean variables represent true/false conditions (e.g., ""overheat"" = TRUE). Flags are individual bits used to track these conditions efficiently, allowing quick checks and updates."
Describe the purpose of the bitwise AND operation in the context of the provided assembly language examples. What is a common use case for this operation?,"Bitwise AND can clear specific bits to zero, effectively resetting flags. A common use case is initializing status bits or isolating a single bit for checking its value."
Explain the purpose of the bitwise XOR operation in the context of the provided assembly language examples. When might this operation be necessary in a control system?,"Bitwise XOR toggles specific bits, flipping them between 0 and 1. This is useful to change the state of a flag, such as reversing an actuator command or indicating a change in condition."
What is Monitoring System?,"A system designed to observe and record the condition of a system over a period of time, often to detect when a physical property goes outside a desired range."
What is Sensor?,"A measuring device that detects a physical property (e.g., temperature, pressure) and converts it into a signal that can be transmitted to a computer or microprocessor."
What is Control System?,A system that includes the capabilities of a monitoring system but also has the ability to influence and adjust the system based on the monitored data.
What is Actuator?,"An electrical or mechanical device that is controlled by a computer and used to manipulate a physical system (e.g., switching a motor on/off, adjusting a valve)."
What is Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC)?,A circuit that converts continuous analogue signals (like voltage from a sensor) into discrete digital values that a computer can process.
What is Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC)?,A circuit that converts discrete digital values from a computer into continuous analogue signals that can be used to control analogue devices like actuators.
What is Feedback?,"Information about the output of a system that is used to adjust the input or control actions, allowing for self-correction and regulation."
What is Closed-Loop Feedback Control System?,"A control system where the feedback from the output is directly used to influence the control action, typically by comparing the actual output to a desired setpoint."
What is Real-Time Program?,"A program that must respond to events and process data within a specific and predictable time frame, crucial for monitoring and control systems that interact with the physical world."
What is Boolean Variable?,"A variable that can have one of two values, typically TRUE or FALSE, often used to represent conditions or states in a program."
What is Flag?,A variable or a specific bit in a memory location that is used to signal a particular condition or status within a program.
What is Bit Manipulation?,"The process of directly working with individual bits within a binary number, often using logical operations to set, clear, or toggle their values."
What is Assembly Language?,"A low-level programming language that corresponds closely to the machine code instructions of a specific computer architecture, often used for direct hardware control and bit manipulation."
What is Bitwise AND?,"A logical operation that compares corresponding bits of two binary numbers; the resulting bit is 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1, otherwise it is 0."
What is Bitwise OR?,A logical operation that compares corresponding bits of two binary numbers; the resulting bit is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
What is Bitwise XOR?,"A logical operation that compares corresponding bits of two binary numbers; the resulting bit is 1 if the corresponding bits are different, and 0 if they are the same."
What is Operand?,A value or memory address that is acted upon by an instruction in a computer program.
What is Accumulator?,A special-purpose register in a CPU where the results of arithmetic and logical operations are often stored.
