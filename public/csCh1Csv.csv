"Discuss the reasons behind the adoption of binary, hexadecimal, and Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) number systems in computer science. Compare and contrast their advantages and disadvantages in different application areas.","Computers adopt the binary system because hardware components such as transistors naturally support two discrete states (on/off), enabling reliable representation and manipulation of data. Hexadecimal is used as a human-friendly shorthand for binary, grouping four bits per digit to simplify reading and writing memory addresses, color codes, and low-level data structures. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) represents each decimal digit with its own four-bit code, preserving exact decimal values in applications like calculators and accounting systems to avoid floating-point rounding errors. In contrasting their use: binary achieves maximal efficiency in storage and computing circuits but is unwieldy for human interpretation; hexadecimal offers a compact, readable view of binary data while maintaining direct bit-level correspondence; and BCD guarantees precise decimal arithmetic at the expense of increased storage requirements and additional logic for arithmetic correction."
"Explain the concepts of 'two's complement' representation and 'sign and magnitude' representation for signed integers. Critically evaluate the benefits of using two's complement in modern computer systems for arithmetic operations.","Two’s complement and sign-and-magnitude are two methods for representing signed integers. In sign-and-magnitude, the most significant bit indicates the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining bits give the magnitude; however, it yields two representations for zero and complicates arithmetic logic. To obtain a two’s complement representation, one inverts all bits (one’s complement) and adds one to the result; this method provides a unique zero representation, simplifies circuit design by unifying addition and subtraction operations, and allows overflow detection through carry bits. Consequently, two’s complement is preferred in modern systems because it reduces hardware complexity, supports straightforward arithmetic, and avoids ambiguity in zero representation."
"Compare and contrast vector graphics and bitmap graphics in terms of their storage methods, scalability, and suitability for different types of images and applications.","Vector graphics and bitmaps differ fundamentally in their storage and rendering. Vector graphics encode images as geometric shapes (lines, curves, polygons) with mathematical attributes, yielding resolution-independent scalability and typically smaller file sizes for diagrams and illustrations; however, rendering complex designs may require significant computational overhead. Bitmap images store a fixed grid of pixels, each with colour information, making them ideal for photographs and detailed images but subject to pixelation when enlarged and requiring substantial storage proportional to resolution and colour depth. Thus, vector suits technical drawings, logos, and scalable graphics, while bitmaps excel in representing continuous-tone images such as photographs and textures."
"Describe the process of digitizing sound using an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Analyze the impact of sampling rate and sampling resolution on the quality and file size of digital audio.","Digitising sound involves sampling and quantisation using an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC). A band-limiting filter removes frequencies above the audible range; then, the ADC measures the amplitude of the waveform at regular intervals defined by the sampling rate and approximates each sample to the nearest level determined by the sampling resolution (bit depth). Higher sampling rates allow accurate capture of higher frequencies in accordance with Nyquist’s theorem, while greater bit depths reduce quantisation error, improving dynamic range. However, increased sampling rate and resolution enlarge file sizes proportionally, necessitating a balance between audio quality and storage or transmission constraints."
"Discuss the principles and applications of both lossless and lossy data compression techniques. Provide specific examples of algorithms used for each type of compression and explain the trade-offs involved.","Lossless and lossy compression techniques serve different use cases. Lossless methods, such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman coding, reduce file size by exploiting redundancy while preserving all original data, allowing perfect reconstruction, and are essential for text, executable files, and archival storage. RLE replaces repeated data runs with a count and symbol value, ideal for simple graphics; Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes based on symbol frequencies to minimise overall bit usage. Lossy compression, exemplified by JPEG for images and MP3 for audio, discards perceptually insignificant information to achieve higher compression ratios, trading fidelity for reduced storage or faster transmission; this is acceptable in multimedia applications where human perception tolerates minor quality loss. In choosing between them, one balances the need for exact data retrieval against acceptable quality degradation and resource constraints."
