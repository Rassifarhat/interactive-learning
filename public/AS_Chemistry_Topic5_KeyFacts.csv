Question,Answer
What is the general formula for alkenes?,CₙH₂ₙ
What defines an alkene?,An unsaturated hydrocarbon with at least one C=C double bond.
What is a sigma (σ) bond?,A bond formed by head-on overlap of orbitals.
What is a pi (π) bond?,A bond formed by sideways overlap of p-orbitals.
Why are alkenes more reactive than alkanes?,"The π bond is weaker and more exposed, making it reactive."
What is geometric (E/Z) isomerism?,A type of stereoisomerism from restricted rotation around a C=C bond.
What are the requirements for E/Z isomerism?,C=C double bond and two different groups on each carbon.
How does E/Z differ from cis/trans naming?,E/Z is based on atomic numbers (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules); cis/trans is simpler and only works for specific cases.
What is an electrophile?,"A species attracted to electrons, accepts an electron pair."
What are typical electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes?,"With H₂, halogens, hydrogen halides, and H₂O."
What happens when ethene reacts with bromine?,"Forms 1,2-dibromoethane via electrophilic addition."
What is the test for a C=C bond?,Bromine water turns from orange to colourless.
What happens when alkenes react with hydrogen?,They form alkanes via hydrogenation.
What is needed for alkene hydrogenation?,Nickel catalyst at 150°C.
What happens when alkenes react with HBr?,Forms haloalkanes via electrophilic addition.
What is Markovnikov's rule?,"In asymmetric alkenes, the H adds to the carbon with more hydrogens."
"What are primary, secondary and tertiary carbocations?",Based on the number of alkyl groups bonded to the positively charged carbon.
Which carbocation is most stable?,Tertiary > Secondary > Primary.
What is polymerisation?,Joining many alkene monomers into a long-chain polymer.
How are addition polymers named?,"Prefix 'poly' + monomer name in brackets (e.g., poly(ethene))."
How is the repeating unit shown?,"By drawing two carbon atoms from the monomer double bond, with brackets and subscript 'n'."
What is a monomer?,A small molecule that can join to form a polymer.
What are the environmental concerns with polymers?,"Non-biodegradable, cause landfill and marine pollution."
What are biodegradable polymers?,Polymers that can break down by microbes.
How can polymers be disposed of sustainably?,"Recycling, incineration, biodegradable development."
What is incineration?,"Burning polymer waste to release energy, but may release toxic gases."
What are examples of polymers from alkenes?,"Poly(ethene), poly(propene), PVC, PTFE."
How does recycling help manage polymer waste?,Reduces landfill use and conserves resources.
What are common uses of poly(propene)?,"Crates, ropes, carpets, packaging."
What is the concern with incinerating halogenated polymers like PVC?,Releases harmful gases like HCl.
What is the role of catalysts in industry?,"Speed up reactions, reduce temperature and energy needed."
How is H₂SO₄ used as a catalyst in alkene reactions?,"Acts as an electrophile adding H⁺, then replaced by nucleophile."
What are green chemistry goals for polymers?,"Reduce waste, use biodegradable materials, safer production."
How can polymers be reused?,By melting and remoulding (thermoplastics).
What is the structure of poly(chloroethene)?,Repeating units from chloroethene monomer with –CH₂–CHCl–.
What does 'repeat unit' mean in polymers?,The specific section of a polymer that repeats along the chain.
What causes restricted rotation in alkenes?,The pi bond above and below the plane of sigma bond.
