Describe the primary role of system software and differentiate it from application software.,"System software manages and controls computer hardware and provides a platform for application software to run, whereas application software is designed to perform specific tasks directly for the user."
Explain why an operating system was a crucial missing component in early computers of the 1960s.,"Without an operating system, users had to directly control the hardware through numerous buttons and manual processes, making it complex and inefficient to run programs and manage resources. An OS provides a layer of abstraction and automates these tasks."
Name two essential user interface types provided by modern operating systems and give a brief characteristic of each.,"Command-line interface (CLI) allows users to interact by typing text commands, while graphical user interface (GUI) lets users interact through visual elements like icons and menus."
"What is resource management in the context of an operating system, and why is it necessary in a modern computer system?","Resource management involves allocating and controlling access to computer resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) among competing processes. It is necessary because multiple processes run concurrently and need orderly access to limited resources."
Outline two key aspects of memory management performed by an operating system to ensure efficient memory usage.,"Memory protection prevents programs from interfering with each other’s memory, and virtual memory allows the system to use disk space to extend apparent RAM and manage running processes efficiently."
Explain the purpose of a device driver and why it is necessary for the operating system to manage computer hardware effectively.,A device driver is software that enables the OS to communicate with and control a specific hardware device. It is necessary because each device has unique characteristics that require specialized instructions for proper operation.
Describe the function of a disk defragmenter utility and explain why it is needed for maintaining hard disk efficiency.,"A disk defragmenter reorganizes fragmented files so that each file’s data is stored in contiguous blocks, which improves disk access speed and overall system performance."
What is the primary advantage of using Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) compared to statically linked library routines in programming?,"DLLs allow multiple programs to share a single copy of the library code in memory, reducing storage requirements for executables and minimizing memory usage when routines are used by multiple processes."
Briefly explain the fundamental difference in how a compiler and an interpreter translate high-level programming code.,"A compiler translates the entire source code into object code before execution, producing an executable. An interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line, requiring the source and interpreter at run time."
Describe two helpful features commonly found in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that assist programmers in writing and debugging code.,"Prettyprinting automatically formats and syntax-highlights code for readability, while debugging tools let programmers set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variable values to identify and fix errors."
What is Application Software?,"Software designed to perform specific tasks for the computer user (e.g., word processors, web browsers)."
What is Command-Line Interface (CLI)?,A user interface where users interact with the operating system by typing text-based commands.
What is Compiler?,A language translator that converts the entire source code of a program into machine code (object code) before execution.
What is Context-Sensitive Prompt?,"A feature in an IDE that displays relevant suggestions (keywords, identifiers) based on the current position in the code."
What is Debugging?,The process of identifying and removing errors (bugs) from computer programs.
What is Device Driver?,Software that enables the operating system to communicate and interact with a specific hardware device.
What is Dynamic Link Library (DLL)?,A library of routines that can be loaded and linked into an executable program at runtime. Multiple programs can share the same DLL in memory.
What is Dynamic Syntax Check?,"A feature in some editors that automatically checks the syntax of code as it is being typed, alerting the programmer to errors."
What is File Compression?,A process of reducing the size of a file to save storage space or make it easier to transmit.
What is File Fragmentation?,"The state where parts of a single file are stored in non-contiguous blocks on a storage device, potentially slowing down access times."
What is Graphical User Interface (GUI)?,"A user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system through visual elements such as icons, menus, and windows."
What is Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?,"A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, typically including a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger."
What is Interpreter?,A language translator that reads and executes source code line by line.
What is Java Byte Code?,"The output of the Java compiler, which is platform-independent and executed by the Java Virtual Machine."
What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?,A virtual machine that allows Java programs to run on different operating systems and hardware configurations.
What is Library Program (Routine)?,"A collection of pre-written, tested subroutines that programmers can include in their own programs to perform specific tasks."
What is Memory Management?,The operating system's function of controlling and coordinating the use of main memory (RAM) among running processes.
What is Memory Protection?,A mechanism used by the operating system to prevent one program from accessing or modifying the memory of another program.
What is Operating System (OS)?,System software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
What is Prettyprinting?,The automatic formatting and syntax highlighting of source code in an editor to improve readability.
What is Process?,An instance of a computer program that is being executed.
What is Program-Hardware Interface?,The way in which the operating system ensures that hardware resources perform the actions requested by software.
What is Resource Management?,"The operating system's function of allocating and managing computer resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) among competing processes."
What is Security Management?,"The operating system's activities related to protecting the computer system and user data from unauthorized access, modification, or loss."
What is System Software?,Software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and provide a platform for running application software.
What is User Interface?,"The means by which a user interacts with a computer system (e.g., CLI, GUI)."
What is Utility Program?,"A type of system software designed to perform specific tasks related to managing and maintaining the computer system (e.g., disk formatter, backup software)."
"Discuss the role of operating systems in managing computer hardware and software resources. Explain how multitasking, memory management, and file systems are implemented in modern operating systems.","Operating systems (OS) act as intermediaries between hardware and software, managing resources like CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices. Multitasking allows multiple programs to run concurrently by allocating CPU time slices. Memory management tracks allocation, swapping, and protection of memory spaces. File systems organize and store data on disk, providing access control and hierarchical structure. Modern OSes use virtual memory, process isolation, and journaling file systems for efficiency and reliability."
"Compare and contrast the features, advantages, and disadvantages of different user interfaces (command-line, graphical, touch-based). Provide examples of when each interface is most appropriate.","Command-line interfaces (CLI) offer precise control and automation but have a steep learning curve. Graphical user interfaces (GUI) are intuitive and visually rich, suitable for most users and applications. Touch-based interfaces enable direct manipulation, ideal for mobile and kiosk devices. Each interface suits different contexts: CLI for system administration, GUI for general computing, and touch for portable devices."
