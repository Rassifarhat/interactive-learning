What is the fundamental difference between an INTEGER and a REAL data type in computer science?,"An INTEGER represents a whole number without any decimal point, while a REAL number is a signed number that can include a decimal point. INTEGER is typically used for whole counts, while REAL is used for potentially fractional values."
Explain the concept of a BOOLEAN data type and provide two possible values it can hold.,A BOOLEAN data type represents logical values and can hold one of two possible values: TRUE or FALSE. It is commonly used in conditional statements to control program flow.
Describe the purpose of a STRING data type and how it differs from a CHAR data type.,"A STRING data type stores a sequence of zero or more characters, effectively representing text, whereas a CHAR data type stores only a single character."
"What is a record data type, and why is it considered a user-defined or composite type?","A record data type groups together variables (fields) of different data types under a single identifier, allowing related data to be organized logically. It is user-defined because the programmer specifies its fields and their types."
Explain the concept of an array and differentiate between a one-dimensional (1D) array and a two-dimensional (2D) array.,"An array is an ordered collection of data items of the same type under a single identifier. A 1D array arranges elements in a single sequence accessed by one index, while a 2D array arranges elements in rows and columns accessed by two indices."
Describe the process of accessing an element within a 1D array using pseudocode. Provide an example.,"To access an element in a 1D array, use the array name followed by the index in square brackets: <arrayIdentifier>[index]. Example: MyList[3] retrieves the element at index 3 in MyList."
"What is a linear search algorithm, and how does it work to find a specific value in a 1D array?","A linear search algorithm checks each element of the array in sequence until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the array, comparing elements one by one."
Explain the basic principle behind the bubble sort algorithm for sorting elements in a 1D array.,"Bubble sort repeatedly passes through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing larger values to 'bubble' to the end with each pass."
"Describe the purpose of text files in programming, and what are the basic operations that can be performed on them using pseudocode.","Text files provide permanent storage for data as lines of characters. Basic operations include OPENFILE for READ/WRITE/APPEND, WRITEFILE to write lines, READFILE to read lines, and CLOSEFILE to close the file."
Define the concept of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and list at least three common ADTs mentioned in the source material.,"An ADT is a conceptual definition of a data structure and its operations without specifying implementation details. Common ADTs include stacks, queues, and linked lists."
"Discuss the role of flowcharts in representing algorithms. Provide an example of how a flowchart can be used to model a decision-making process in computing.","Flowcharts visually represent the sequence of steps in an algorithm using standardized symbols (e.g., rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions). They clarify logic, identify inefficiencies, and aid communication. For example, a flowchart for login authentication shows steps for input, validation, and access control, highlighting decision points for correct or incorrect credentials."
"Explain the differences between linear and binary search algorithms. Analyze their efficiencies and appropriate use cases.","Linear search scans each element sequentially, suitable for small or unsorted lists. Binary search repeatedly divides a sorted list, halving the search space each step, making it efficient (O(log n)) for large, sorted data. Choosing the right algorithm depends on data size and order."
