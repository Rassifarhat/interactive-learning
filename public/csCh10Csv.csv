"How does the chapter define ""ethics"" in the context of computing professionals?","This chapter focuses on the definition of ethics as the rules of conduct recognized in a particular profession or area of human life, specifically within the realm of computer science and software development. It emphasizes that while these rules may be profession-specific (like codes of conduct), they should ultimately reflect broader moral principles concerning right and wrong. The foundation for these rules lies in philosophical and pragmatic views of what is right and common sense."
What role do professional organizations play in guiding the ethical behavior of computing professionals?,"Professional organizations, such as the British Computer Society (BCS), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), provide codes of conduct that offer guidance on ethical practices for their members. These codes typically emphasize principles such as acting in the public interest, maintaining professional competence and integrity, fulfilling duties to relevant authorities and the profession, and exercising independent judgment while seeking advice when unsure."
The chapter presents a scenario about limited software testing time. How can the IEEE-CS/ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics guide a professional in this situation?,"In the scenario where a project manager reduces testing time, a software engineer can refer to the eight principles of the IEEE-CS/ACM code. For instance, the principle of 'Public' (acting consistently with public interest) would raise concerns about delivering a potentially faulty product. 'Product' (ensuring products meet high professional standards) is directly compromised by insufficient testing. 'Judgement' (maintaining integrity and independence) requires the engineer to assess the risks of inadequate testing. 'Management' (promoting an ethical approach to management) suggests the manager's decision should be challenged. By considering each principle, the professional can justify challenging the decision and advocating for adequate testing to ensure a quality product that serves the client and the public interest."
What is copyright and what are its key characteristics?,"Copyright is a formal legal recognition of ownership granted to the creator of original published work. It applies to various forms of work, including literary works, musical compositions, films, computer programs, and more. Key characteristics include that it applies to the expression of an idea, not the idea itself, and it cannot be claimed on previously published work. Copyright aims to incentivize creation by granting the owner the opportunity to earn money from their work and preventing unauthorized reproduction for profit without the creator's permission. Typically, copyright laws involve registration, a defined period of validity, policies for inheritance, and methods for indicating copyright (e.g., the symbol)."
How does software licensing differ between commercial and open/free software?,"With commercial software, when you 'buy' it, you are typically purchasing an end-user license that grants you the right to use the software under specific conditions, but you do not own the software itself; ownership remains with the vendor. These licenses often restrict how the software can be used, copied, or distributed, and the source code is usually not provided. Licensing fees can be per-copy or via site licenses. Shareware (trial basis) and freeware (no time limit, potentially limited functionality) are exceptions where licenses might be initially free. Open or free licensing, as promoted by organizations like the Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation, emphasizes user freedoms. With open source software, the source code is provided, and users are generally free to use, modify, copy, and distribute the software according to the license terms, often at no cost. The Free Software Foundation's 'copyleft' license adds the condition that any modifications to the software must also be made available under the same open terms, ensuring the freedom of the software is maintained."
What are some examples of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and what aspects of human intelligence do they aim to mimic?,"The chapter highlights several AI applications mimicking human intelligence: chess-playing programs demonstrate problem-solving by exploring vast numbers of potential moves within the game's rules; expert systems for medical diagnosis attempt to replicate knowledge and reasoning by storing and applying rules derived from human experts; voice recognition and synthesis mimic linguistics by enabling computers to understand and generate spoken language; autonomous robots and driverless cars exhibit perception by using sensors to interact with and react to their environment; machine learning systems that personalize website recommendations or filter spam learn from data, mimicking the human ability to learn from experience."
What are some of the potential ethical and societal concerns associated with the development and use of AI?,"The increasing prevalence of AI raises several ethical and societal concerns. The collection and storage of massive amounts of user data by AI-powered systems raise concerns about privacy, security, and potential misuse. The introduction of autonomous mechanical products like robots and driverless vehicles sparks debates about job displacement, safety, and accountability in case of accidents. Furthermore, the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of these technologies is a significant concern. The potential for AI systems to replace human professionals in fields like healthcare also raises complex social consequences."
How does the concept of 'public good' relate to the responsibilities of computing professionals?,"The concept of 'public good' is a central theme in the ethics of computing professionals. Codes of conduct often emphasize that professionals should act in the public interest, considering the health, safety, welfare, and well-being of the public and the environment. Examples like the Ariane 5 rocket explosion, the Mars Climate Orbiter failure, and the UK's NHS IT program demonstrate the potential for significant negative consequences (financial and otherwise) when software engineering practices are flawed. Beyond avoiding disasters, the public good also involves considering the ethical implications of technology, such as data privacy, security, and the potential for harm caused by systems or their misuse. However, defining and acting on the public good can be challenging due to diverse public opinions and the difficulty for individuals to exert influence against powerful entities."
Define ethics according to the focus of this chapter. How does this definition relate to broader moral principles?,"Ethics, in the context of this chapter, refers to the rules of conduct recognized in a particular profession or area of human life. However, these professional rules of conduct should be grounded in broader moral principles that concern right and wrong."
Identify two professional organizations mentioned in the text that provide ethical guidance for computing professionals. What is a key feature of the guidance they offer?,The British Computer Society (BCS) and the IEEE-CS/ACM are two professional organizations mentioned. They both offer a code of conduct that provides guidance on ethical practice for their members.
"According to the IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force Software Engineering Code of Ethics, what is a primary concern for software engineers? List one other consistent principle across different codes of conduct.",A key concern according to the IEEE-CS/ACM code is the public interest or public good. Another consistent principle across codes is the expectation that the professional will exercise their own judgement in ethical situations.
"In the worked example, the project manager limits software testing time. Briefly explain two principles from the IEEE-CS/ACM code that should guide a software engineer's response to this situation.",The 'Product' principle (ensure products meet the highest professional standards) and the 'Judgement' principle (maintain integrity and independence in professional judgement) should guide the engineer to challenge the decision due to potentially poor quality software resulting from insufficient testing.
The text provides examples of software failures like the Ariane 5 rocket and the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter. What common concern did these failures primarily highlight regarding software engineering?,"These failures primarily highlighted the public interest in successful software engineering, particularly concerning the potential for significant financial losses due to errors in specification, development, and testing."
Explain the fundamental concept of copyright. What are two types of works that can be protected by copyright?,Copyright is a formal recognition of ownership for original published works. Examples of works that can be copyrighted include literary works and computer programs.
What is the key difference between purchasing commercial software and purchasing a physical product like a computer in terms of ownership? What does a software buyer typically acquire instead?,"When purchasing commercial software, the buyer does not become the owner; ownership remains with the vendor. Instead, the buyer typically acquires an end-user license that grants them the right to use the software."
Distinguish between shareware and freeware. What is the typical condition associated with shareware?,"Shareware is commercial software available on a trial basis for a limited time, potentially being a full or limited version. Freeware is also often a limited or earlier version of commercial software, but the license has no time limit."
Describe one application of artificial intelligence mentioned in the text and the aspect of human intelligence it aims to mimic. Briefly mention a potential benefit or concern associated with this application.,"One application is an expert system for medical diagnosis, which mimics the problem-solving aspect of human intelligence by using data and rules from medical experts. A potential benefit is that it can provide a broader knowledge base than a single doctor."
Explain the concept of 'copyleft' associated with the Free Software Foundation. What is the main condition imposed by this type of license?,"'Copyleft' is a special feature of the Free Software Foundation's license where if the software is modified, the source code for the modified version must be made available to other users under the same usage conditions."
"Discuss the principles of computer security, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Analyze common threats and countermeasures for each principle.","Computer security ensures confidentiality (protection from unauthorized access), integrity (protection from unauthorized modification), and availability (ensuring resources are accessible when needed). Threats include malware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and insider threats. Countermeasures include encryption, access controls, backups, firewalls, and user education. A layered approach (defense in depth) is essential for robust security."
"Explain the concepts of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Compare their use cases, strengths, and weaknesses in securing digital communication.","Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES), offering speed and efficiency but requiring secure key exchange. Asymmetric encryption uses public/private key pairs (e.g., RSA), enabling secure key distribution and digital signatures but with greater computational overhead. Both are used together in secure protocols like TLS."
