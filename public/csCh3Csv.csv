"Discuss the trade-offs involved in the design of a computer system's memory hierarchy. Analyze the factors that influence the choice of different memory components (registers, cache, main memory, secondary storage) and explain why a compromise is necessary to balance cost, speed, and capacity.","The memory hierarchy balances access speed, capacity, and cost. Registers and cache, located closest to the CPU, provide the fastest access times but are expensive per byte and offer limited capacity. Main memory (RAM) sits below cache in speed and cost, offering greater capacity at lower cost. Secondary storage—such as hard disks and SSDs—provides large, non-volatile capacity at the lowest cost per byte but with much slower access. Designers choose a mix of these components to ensure that frequently accessed data resides in faster, costlier layers, while bulk data is kept in slower, cheaper layers. This compromise ensures overall system performance and cost‐effectiveness."
"Compare and contrast the different types of secondary storage media discussed in the text (magnetic, optical, and solid-state). For each type, describe its fundamental working principles, key advantages, and disadvantages, and discuss their current relevance in modern computing systems.","Magnetic media (hard disks, tapes) store data via magnetic polarization of platters or tape surfaces. Advantages include low cost per gigabyte and high capacity; disadvantages include mechanical parts prone to wear and lower access speeds. Optical media (CD, DVD, Blu‑ray) use laser reflection to read pits and lands in a spiral track. They offer portability and durability but limited rewritability and lower capacity compared to other media. Solid-state media (SSDs, flash drives) use semiconductor cells to store charges; they have no moving parts, providing fast random access, low latency, and mechanical resilience. However, they remain more expensive per gigabyte and have finite write cycles. Today, SSDs dominate for system drives due to performance, while magnetic drives serve archival needs and optical media are used for distribution and backups."
"Explain the operational principles of two distinct output devices provided for a user of a general-purpose computer system (e.g., screen display and printer). For each device, describe the underlying technology and how it converts digital data into a human-perceptible output.","Screen displays use a pixel matrix to form images. In an LCD, each pixel has red, green, and blue sub‑pixels whose liquid crystals modulate backlighting intensity. Voltage applied to each sub‑pixel changes crystal orientation, controlling light transmission and thus color. The rapid refresh of pixels creates smooth images. Printers convert digital page descriptions into hardcopy. In a laser printer, a rotating drum is electrostatically charged; a laser selectively discharges areas corresponding to image data. Toner particles adhere to discharged regions, are transferred to paper, and fused by heat rollers to produce permanent text or graphics."
"Describe the functionality of two different input devices used in a general-purpose computer system (e.g., keyboard and touch screen). Explain how each device captures user input and how this input is processed by the computer system. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each for different user interactions.","A keyboard uses a key matrix where each key press closes a circuit at a unique row‑column intersection. A microcontroller scans these intersections, identifies the pressed key, looks up its character code in ROM, and sends it to the CPU for processing and display. Keyboards excel at precise text entry but are less intuitive for spatial gestures. Touch screens detect contact via resistive or capacitive sensing. In capacitive screens, a finger alters local capacitance; the controller measures these changes to compute coordinates. Touch screens support direct, intuitive interaction but can suffer false touches and require calibration."
Discuss the increasing prevalence of embedded systems and the implications of connecting them to networks as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Analyze the benefits of network connectivity for embedded systems and the emerging security concerns associated with their increased accessibility.,"Embedded systems are now ubiquitous in appliances, vehicles, and sensors. Embedding connectivity enables remote monitoring, firmware updates, and data aggregation, enhancing functionality and efficiency in IoT ecosystems. Networked embedded devices can optimize resource use, support predictive maintenance, and integrate seamlessly into larger applications. However, their constrained hardware often lacks robust security measures, making them vulnerable entry points for cyberattacks. Issues include inadequate encryption, weak authentication, and limited update mechanisms. Therefore, secure design, regular patching, and network segmentation are critical to mitigate risks."
