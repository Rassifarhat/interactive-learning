How can the trend in reactivity of elements in Groups 1 and 2 be explained based on ionization energy?,"# Reactivity Trends
The reactivity of elements increases down both Group 1 and Group 2. This can be explained by the decrease in energy needed to remove the electron from each atom of the element. The lower the ionisation energy, the more easily the metal atoms lose electrons to form positive ions during reactions.

What are the rules for determining oxidation numbers in chemical compounds and ions?,"# Rules for Determining Oxidation Numbers
• The oxidation number of an uncombined element is zero.
• The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in a neutral compound is zero.
• The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
• The more electronegative element in a substance is given a negative oxidation number.
• The oxidation number of fluorine is always -1.
• The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when combined with a less electronegative element. Then it is -1.
• The oxidation number of oxygen is -2, except in peroxides where it is -1 and when combined with fluorine when it is +2.

"How is balancing achieved when constructing full ionic equations from half-equations, considering the example of adding solid zinc to copper(II) sulfate solution?","# Balancing by Counting Electrons
When constructing full ionic equations from half-equations, the electrons must balance out. For example, when solid zinc is added to copper(II) sulfate solution:

Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻
Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)

Adding these together gives: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)

If the half-equations contain different numbers of electrons, they must be multiplied by appropriate factors before adding.

"What are the key factors contributing to the trend of decreasing ionisation energies down Group 1 and Group 2 elements, and how does this trend relate to the reactivity of these groups?","# Ionisation Energy Trends
First ionisation energy is the energy required to remove an electron from each atom in one mole of atoms in the gaseous state: M(g) → M⁺(g) + e⁻

Second ionisation energy is the energy required to remove an electron from each singly charged positive ion in one mole of positive ions in the gaseous state: M⁺(g) → M²⁺(g) + e⁻

Ionisation energies decrease down both Group 1 and Group 2 due to:
• Increased distance between nucleus and outer electrons
• Greater shielding from inner electron shells

This trend explains the increasing reactivity down both groups.
