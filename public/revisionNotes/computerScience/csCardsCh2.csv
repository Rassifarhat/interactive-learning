What are the advantages and differences between peer-to-peer networking and client-server file downloading models?,"# Peer-to-Peer Model
In a peer-to-peer network, computers connect directly to each other without relying on a dedicated server. Each peer can function as both a client and a server, requesting and providing resources.

Advantages of peer-to-peer networking compared to client-server file downloading include:
- Avoids network congestion when many clients download simultaneously
- Parts of files can be downloaded separately
- Files are available from multiple hosts

Client-server advantages include:
- Organizations can better control file downloading and usage
- Files can be better protected from malware through centralized security measures

What are the key characteristics and limitations of mesh topology in computer networking?,"# Mesh Topology
In a mesh topology, each device connects directly to every other device in the network. This topology:

- Uses point-to-point connections between all end-systems
- Supports duplex transmission and all message types
- Provides multiple paths for data, enhancing reliability
- Requires extensive cabling, making it impractical for large end-system networks

Mesh topologies are more commonly used to connect network infrastructure devices like switches and routers rather than end-user systems.
