In what ways does the denary (decimal) number system operate and how is it represented mathematically based on the positions of digits?,"# Denary Numbers
The denary (decimal) number system is base-10 and uses the digits 0-9. Each position in a denary number represents a power of 10.

For example, the number 346 represents: (3 × 10²) + (4 × 10¹) + (6 × 10⁰) = 300 + 40 + 6 = 346

This is the number system we use in everyday life.

"What is the process for converting hexadecimal to binary and vice versa, and how can binary numbers be converted to hexadecimal using the given rules?","# Hexadecimal Conversions
Converting hexadecimal to binary: Each hex digit converts to 4 bits
0 → 0000, 1 → 0001, ..., 9 → 1001, A → 1010, B → 1011, ..., F → 1111

Converting binary to hexadecimal: Group bits into sets of 4, starting from the right, and convert each group to a hex digit.

Example: Binary 1011 0101 to hex: 1011 = B, 0101 = 5, so the result is B5

What do decimal prefixes represent and provide examples of commonly used ones?,"# Decimal Prefixes
Decimal prefixes represent powers of 10:

- kilo (k): 10³ = 1,000
- mega (M): 10⁶ = 1,000,000
- giga (G): 10⁹ = 1,000,000,000
- tera (T): 10¹² = 1,000,000,000,000

For example, 23.567 km means 23.567 × 10³ meters.

"What are the two representation methods for signed integers, and why is two's complement the most commonly used method in computers?","# Integer Coding
Unsigned integers are stored simply as binary numbers. The number of bytes allocated determines the range of possible values.

For signed integers (that can be positive or negative), two representation methods exist:

1. Sign and magnitude: Uses one bit to indicate the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative)

2. Two's complement: The most common method used in computers for representing signed integers.
