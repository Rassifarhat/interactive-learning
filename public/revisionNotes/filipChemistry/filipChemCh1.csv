"What are the characteristics of the three states of matter in terms of particle arrangement, movement, and energy, and how do interconversions between these states occur?","# Describe the three states of matter in terms of the arrangement, movement, and energy of the particles, and explain the interconversions between the three states of matter.
The three states of matter are solids, liquids, and gases. In solids, particles are closely packed in a fixed arrangement, vibrating in place, and have low energy. In liquids, particles are close together but can move past each other, leading to a moderate amount of energy. In gases, particles are far apart, moving freely and rapidly, with high energy. Interconversions include melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), condensation (gas to liquid), evaporation (liquid to gas), and sublimation (solid to gas). These changes can be achieved by altering temperature or pressure, resulting in changes in particle arrangement, movement, and energy. For example, heating a solid provides energy, allowing particles to move apart and transition to a liquid state.
