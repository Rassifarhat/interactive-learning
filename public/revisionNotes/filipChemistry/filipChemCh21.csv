How does the double arrow in the given equation indicate that the thermal decomposition of ammonium chloride is a reversible reaction?,"# 1 The thermal decomposition of ammonium chloride is a reversible reaction.
$$
\mathrm{NH}*{4} \mathrm{Cl}(	ext{~s}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}*{3}(	ext{~g})+\mathrm{HCl}(	ext{~g})
$$
a Explain how the equation shows that the reaction is reversible.
b Give one observation associated with the forward reaction.
c Name all the substances present in the reaction mixture if an equilibrium state is reached.
a The equation shows that the reaction is reversible because it is indicated by the double arrow (\rightleftharpoons) between the reactants and products, signifying that the reaction can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions. 
b One observation associated with the forward reaction is that when ammonium chloride is heated, the white solid disappears, and colorless gases (ammonia and hydrogen chloride) can be seen. 
c The substances present in the reaction mixture at equilibrium will be ammonium chloride (\mathrm{NH}*{4} \mathrm{Cl}(	ext{~s})), ammonia (\mathrm{NH}*{3}(	ext{~g})), and hydrogen chloride (\mathrm{HCl}(	ext{~g})).
