What are the characteristics and examples of exothermic and endothermic reactions?,"# Describe the characteristics of exothermic and endothermic reactions, providing examples for each.
Exothermic reactions release heat, causing the reaction mixture to become hot; examples include burning natural gas and the reaction between CaO and water in hand warmers. Endothermic reactions absorb heat, resulting in a cold mixture; examples include the reaction of citric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate in sherbet and the cooking of an egg, which requires a constant energy supply.
