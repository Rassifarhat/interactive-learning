"What is the predicted mass spectrum for chlorine gas when analyzed using a mass spectrometer, considering the relative abundances of its stable isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37?","# A sample of chlorine gas is analyzed using a mass spectrometer. Given that chlorine has two stable isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, with relative abundances of 75% and 25% respectively, predict the mass spectrum for chlorine, including the relative peak heights for each isotope and the molecular ion peak for Cl2.
The mass spectrum will show three main peaks: one at m/z 70 (Cl2-35), one at m/z 72 (Cl-35Cl-37), and one at m/z 74 (Cl2-37). The relative peak heights will be approximately 9:6:1, corresponding to the isotopic abundances (Cl-35: 75% x 75% = 56.25%, Cl-35/Cl-37: 75% x 25% = 18.75%, Cl-37: 25% x 25% = 6.25%).

"""Why is the relative atomic mass of an element always within the range of the relative isotopic masses of its isotopes?""","# Explain why the relative atomic mass of an element is always between the relative isotopic masses of its isotopes.
The relative atomic mass is a weighted average of the isotopic masses, reflecting the natural abundance of each isotope, thus it must fall between the lowest and highest isotopic masses.

"What is the difference between relative atomic mass and relative isotopic mass, and how are they defined?","# Define relative atomic mass and relative isotopic mass.
Relative atomic mass is the weighted mean mass of an atom of an element compared to 1/12 the mass of carbon-12. Relative isotopic mass is the mass of an atom of an isotope compared to 1/12 the mass of carbon-12.

How can a mass spectrum be utilized to determine the relative atomic mass of an element?,"# Explain how a mass spectrum can be used to determine the relative atomic mass of an element.
A mass spectrum provides the relative masses of isotopes and their percentage abundances. By multiplying the mass of each isotope by its abundance (as a fraction), summing these values, and dividing by the total abundance, the relative atomic mass can be calculated.

What is the definition of an isotope and how do isotopes differ from each other?,"# Define the term “isotope”.
Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same Z) that have different mass numbers because they contain different numbers of neutrons; identical electronic configurations ↔ identical chemical properties, but physical properties (density, b.p.) differ. citeturn1file0
