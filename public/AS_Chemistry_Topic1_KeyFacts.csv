What is Avogadro's constant?,6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ – the number of particles in 1 mole
How many particles are in one mole?,Same as the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12
What is relative atomic mass (Aᵣ)?,The average mass of atoms compared to 1/12th of a carbon-12 atom
What formula do you use to calculate moles from mass?,"n = m / M, where n is moles, m is mass, M is molar mass"
What is the molar gas volume at room temperature and pressure?,"24.0 dm³ or 24,000 cm³ per mole"
What is the ideal gas equation and its units?,"pV = nRT, with p in Pa, V in m³, T in K, R = 8.31 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹"
How do you convert volume units for gases?,"dm³ to m³ divide by 1000, cm³ to m³ divide by 1,000,000"
What is relative molecular mass (Mᵣ)?,The mass of a molecule compared to 1/12th of a carbon-12 atom
What is an empirical formula?,The simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound
How do you find molecular formula from empirical?,Molecular formula = Empirical formula × integer
What equation relates gas properties under ideal conditions?,pV = nRT
How is mass calculated from moles and molar mass?,mass = moles × Mᵣ
What is the formula for molar concentration?,Concentration (mol dm⁻³) = moles / volume (dm³)
How do you calculate mass concentration?,Mass concentration = mass of solute / volume of solution (g dm⁻³)
What is the formula for percentage yield?,Percentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100
What is the formula for atom economy?,Atom economy = (mass of desired product / total mass of reactants) × 100
What is the ionic equation for acid-base neutralisation?,H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O
How do you write a half-equation for zinc?,Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
What are the three general acid reaction types?,"Acid + Metal → Salt + H₂, Acid + Base → Salt + H₂O, Acid + Carbonate → Salt + H₂O + CO₂"
What salts are typically soluble?,"All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts; most chlorides and sulfates"
Which salts are insoluble and form precipitates?,"AgCl, BaSO₄, PbSO₄, CaCO₃"
What happens when AgNO₃ reacts with NaCl?,A white precipitate of AgCl forms: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃
Why omit spectator ions in ionic equations?,"To focus on actual chemical change, not ions that remain unchanged"
What are some molar masses to memorise?,"H₂O = 18, CO₂ = 44, NaCl = 58.5"
What are the steps to determine empirical formula from masses?,"Divide each mass by Aᵣ, then divide all by the smallest value"
What is the visible test for HCl and NH₃ gases?,They form a white smoke of ammonium chloride
What is the test for CO₂ gas?,Turns limewater milky: Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O
What is the equation for magnesium reacting with HCl?,Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂
What happens when zinc reacts with copper sulfate?,Zinc displaces copper: Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu
How does chlorine displace bromine from KBr?,Cl₂ + 2KBr → 2KCl + Br₂
What is the formula to calculate theoretical yield?,Theoretical yield = moles × Mᵣ
What is the formula to calculate ppm?,ppm = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 10⁶
What is 1% in ppm?,"1% = 10,000 ppm"
What is the formula for gas volume at r.t.p.?,"Volume = 24,000 × moles"
What should you ensure when using mole formulas in solutions?,Volume must be in dm³ before applying formulas
How do you identify the limiting reagent?,Compare mole ratios from the balanced chemical equation
