Question,Answer
What is oxidation in terms of electron transfer?,Oxidation is the loss of electrons.
What is reduction in terms of electron transfer?,Reduction is the gain of electrons.
What is an oxidising agent?,An oxidising agent is a species that gains electrons and causes oxidation of another species.
What is a reducing agent?,A reducing agent is a species that loses electrons and causes reduction of another species.
What is a disproportionation reaction?,A disproportionation reaction is one where a single species is simultaneously oxidised and reduced.
What is the oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds?,The oxidation number of oxygen is generally -2.
What is the oxidation number of hydrogen in most compounds?,The oxidation number of hydrogen is usually +1.
What is the oxidation number of fluorine in compounds?,Fluorine always has an oxidation number of -1.
What does a change in oxidation number indicate in a redox reaction?,"An increase indicates oxidation, a decrease indicates reduction."
What is the general rule for the sum of oxidation numbers in a compound?,The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero.
Why is group 1 element reactivity increasing down the group?,"Because the outermost electron is further from the nucleus, making it easier to lose."
What is the trend in ionisation energy down Group 2?,Ionisation energy decreases down Group 2.
What is the general reaction of group 1 metals with water?,2M(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2MOH(aq) + H2(g)
What is formed when a Group 2 metal reacts with water?,A metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas are formed.
What is the trend in solubility of Group 2 hydroxides?,Solubility increases down the group.
What is the trend in solubility of Group 2 sulfates?,Solubility decreases down the group.
Which Group 2 compound is used in agriculture to neutralise soil acidity?,Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime)
What is thermal stability?,Thermal stability is a measure of how resistant a compound is to decomposition by heat.
What is the trend in thermal stability of Group 2 nitrates?,Thermal stability increases down the group.
Why does thermal stability increase down Group 2?,"Larger cations polarise the anion less, so the compound is more stable."
"What are the flame test colours for lithium, sodium, potassium?","Lithium: red, Sodium: yellow-orange, Potassium: lilac."
What causes flame test colours?,Excited electrons release energy as visible light when they fall back to lower energy levels.
What ion is identified by adding NaOH and observing ammonia gas release?,Ammonium ion (NH4+).
What is the trend in melting and boiling points down Group 7?,Melting and boiling points increase due to stronger London forces.
What is the trend in reactivity of Group 7 elements?,Reactivity decreases down the group.
What happens when chlorine reacts with cold dilute sodium hydroxide?,Disproportionation occurs producing NaCl and NaClO.
What is the reaction of chlorine with water?,Cl2 + H2O ⇌ HCl + HClO.
Why does Cl2 both oxidise and reduce in reaction with water?,Chlorine is reduced to Cl⁻ and oxidised to Cl⁺ in HClO.
Which halide reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce SO2?,Bromide ion.
Which halide produces H2S when reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid?,Iodide ion.
What precipitate is formed when AgNO3 is added to Cl⁻?,White precipitate of AgCl.
What is the solubility of silver halides in ammonia?,AgCl is soluble in dilute ammonia; AgBr is soluble in concentrated; AgI is insoluble.
What is a standard solution?,A solution of accurately known concentration.
What is a titration?,A technique to find the concentration of a solution by reacting it with another of known concentration.
What is the difference between precision and accuracy?,Precision is repeatability of results; accuracy is closeness to true value.
What is measurement uncertainty?,Measurement uncertainty is the range within which the true value lies.
