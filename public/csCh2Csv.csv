"Discuss the evolution of networking technologies from the 1970s to the present day, highlighting the key motivations and benefits associated with the introduction of WANs, LANs, and the Internet.","In the 1970s, organizations relied on mainframes and minicomputers that were isolated at each site. Wide Area Networks (WANs) emerged to connect these systems over long distances, enabling remote job execution, data archive access, and electronic messaging. During the 1980s, the rise of personal computers led to Local Area Networks (LANs), which linked PCs within a building or campus for centralized software installation, file sharing, print services, and internal email, paving the way for the ‘paper-less office.’ The 1990s saw the advent of internetworking and the Internet, which connected LANs and WANs globally using packet-switched networks, transforming networking into a ubiquitous service. Today, modern networks integrate wireless technologies, mobile access, and cloud computing services, further extending connectivity to personal devices and enabling scalable, on-demand resources."
"Compare and contrast the technical characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of the four primary network topologies discussed in the source material (bus, star, mesh, and point-to-point), and explain why the star topology has become the dominant choice for modern LANs.","Bus topology uses a single shared link for all devices, making it inexpensive and easy to install but prone to collisions and single points of failure at the cable ends. Star topology connects each device to a central hub or switch, offering fault isolation and simple management; however, the central device is a critical point of failure. Mesh topology provides dedicated links between every pair of devices, ensuring high redundancy and reliability but at the cost of excessive cabling and complexity. Point-to-point links connect exactly two devices, offering secure, dedicated communication but limited scalability. The star topology dominates modern LANs because switches mitigate collisions, simplify network growth, and isolate faults without the cabling overhead of full mesh networks."
"Analyze the factors that must be considered when selecting a transmission medium (wired or wireless) for a network, and discuss the trade-offs between different types of cable and wireless technologies in terms of performance, cost, and suitability for various applications.","Choosing a transmission medium involves evaluating bandwidth, attenuation, interference susceptibility, installation cost, and environmental constraints. Twisted pair cables are low-cost and easy to install but have limited bandwidth and high interference, making them suitable for typical office LANs. Coaxial cables offer moderate bandwidth and better shielding but at higher cost and bulk. Fibre-optic cables provide very high bandwidth and immunity to electromagnetic interference, ideal for backbone links, albeit at greater installation expense. Wireless media (radio, microwave, infrared) eliminate cabling costs and support mobility but can suffer interference, security challenges, and range limitations. The choice depends on required data rates, budget, installation environment, and future scalability."
"Explain the fundamental principles behind IP addressing (both IPv4 and IPv6) and the Domain Name System (DNS), and discuss their critical roles in enabling communication and resource location on the Internet.","IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, divided into network and host portions, originally in fixed classes (A, B, C) and later in classless CIDR format to conserve address space. Due to exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was developed with 128-bit addresses represented in colon-separated hexadecimal, vastly increasing available addresses and simplifying routing. DNS is a hierarchical, distributed directory service that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It uses root, TLD, and authoritative servers, employing caching and recursive queries to resolve names efficiently. Together, IP addressing ensures that data packets reach the correct destinations, while DNS provides a user-friendly naming layer."
"Describe the client-server and peer-to-peer networking models, compare their advantages and disadvantages for file sharing, and discuss the significance of the client-server model in modern Internet applications such as cloud computing and bit streaming.","In the client-server model, clients request resources from centralized servers, which simplifies management, security, and backup but can create bottlenecks and require server infrastructure. Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks distribute file sharing among peers, enhancing scalability and reducing single points of failure but posing challenges in content control, consistency, and security. Client-server underpins cloud computing and bit streaming by providing centralized resource pools and reliable delivery, enabling services like SaaS, CDN distribution, and adaptive streaming with controlled quality of service."
