Define computational thinking and list its five key strands as outlined in the text.,"Computational thinking is a problem-solving process involving a logical approach to analyze a problem and produce a human-understandable solution that computers can use. Its five key strands are abstraction, decomposition, data modelling, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking."
Explain the concept of abstraction in computational thinking and provide an example from the text other than the aerial photograph task.,"Abstraction involves filtering out unnecessary information to focus on the essential details needed to solve a problem. The London Underground map example illustrates abstraction by showing only stations and connecting lines, omitting geographical accuracy and street details relevant for journey planning."
"What is an algorithm as described in the text, and why is the correct logical sequence of steps important? Provide an example.","An algorithm is a sequence of step-by-step instructions designed to solve a problem. The correct logical sequence is crucial because performing steps out of order can lead to incorrect results or make the process impossible, as demonstrated by the car wheel changing example."
Describe the difference between structured English and pseudocode when expressing algorithms.,Structured English is a subset of the English language consisting of command statements used to express algorithms. Pseudocode resembles a programming language but does not adhere to the specific syntax of any particular programming language.
Name and briefly describe the four basic types of constructs used when writing algorithms in computer science.,"The four basic constructs are: Assignment (assigning a value to a variable), Sequence (executing steps in order), Selection (choosing steps based on conditions), and Repetition (looping a block of steps multiple times)."
Explain the purpose of a variable in programming and provide two examples of operations that can be performed on variables as described in the text.,"A variable is a named memory location used to store data values that can be manipulated within an algorithm. Examples of operations on variables include assigning a value to a variable and updating the value of a variable (e.g., incrementing it)."
"What is a logic statement in the context of algorithm design, and what are relational operators used for? Provide one example of a relational operator and its meaning.","A logic statement uses conditions, often involving logic propositions and relational operators, to determine the flow of an algorithm. Relational operators compare values; for example, ""="" means ""is equal to""."
"Describe the difference between a REPEAT...UNTIL loop and a WHILE...ENDWHILE loop, focusing on when the condition is checked.","A REPEAT...UNTIL loop checks its condition at the end of the loop, so the loop body executes at least once. A WHILE...ENDWHILE loop checks its condition before the loop body, so it may not execute at all if the condition is initially false."
Explain the concept of stepwise refinement and why it is a useful technique in algorithm design.,"Stepwise refinement is a top-down design technique where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each of which is further refined until it can be directly implemented. This makes developing complex algorithms more systematic and understandable."
"What is a module in algorithm design, and what are the two main types of modules discussed in the text?","A module is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific sub-task within a larger program. The two main types are procedures, which group steps under a name, and functions, which group steps and return a value."
