"Question 3: The equation for a reaction is: 2KOH(aq) + Cl₂(g) → KCl(aq) + KClO(aq) + H₂O(l). Which equation represents a disproportionation reaction? Options: A) 2LiOH + F₂ → 2LiF + H₂O; B) 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S + 2H₂O; C) 2NO₂ + H₂O → HNO₃ + HNO₂; D) KF + H₂SO₄ → KHSO₄ + HF","Answer: C. Explanation: A disproportionation reaction is one where an element is both oxidised and reduced. In option C, nitrogen in NO₂ has an oxidation state of +4; in HNO₃ it becomes +5 (oxidation) and in HNO₂ it becomes +3 (reduction)."
"Question 4: Which equation represents the process that occurs when the second ionisation energy of strontium is measured? Options: A) Sr(s) → Sr⁺(g) + e⁻; B) Sr⁺(g) → Sr²⁺(g) + e⁻; C) Sr²⁺(g) → Sr³⁺(g) + e⁻; D) Sr(g) → Sr²⁺(g) + 2e⁻","Answer: B. Explanation: The second ionisation energy involves removing an electron from a singly charged ion. Thus, the process is Sr⁺(g) → Sr²⁺(g) + e⁻."
"Question 7: Most chlorine-based bleaches contain the ClO⁻ ion. (a) State the oxidation number of chlorine in the ClO⁻ ion. (b) The ClO⁻ ion is produced when chlorine gas is reacted with water. Write an ionic equation for when chlorine is added to water to undergo 'disproportionation'. (c) Chlorine forms another ion with the formula ClO₃⁻. This ion exists in the compound KClO₃. Deduce the oxidation number of chlorine according to the equation: 4KClO₃ → 3KClO₄ + KCl and comment on the change in oxidation number.","Answer: (a) +1. Explanation: Since oxygen is normally -2, for ClO⁻ (with an overall charge of -1) the chlorine must be +1. (b) Cl₂(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HClO(aq) + H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). (c) In KClO₃, Cl is +5; in KClO₄, Cl is +7; and in KCl, Cl is -1. The reaction shows oxidation of chlorine from +5 to +7 and reduction from +5 to -1."
"Question 8: Bromine is present in sea water as aqueous bromide ions. Br₂(aq) can be extracted from sea water by adding chlorine. The ionic equation for the reaction is: Cl₂(aq) + 2Br⁻(aq) → 2Cl⁻(aq) + Br₂(aq). (a)(i) Define oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer. (a)(ii) Identify the oxidising agent in the reaction and justify your answer. (b) The chlorine required for bromine extraction is produced by electrolysis with the half-equations: Anode: 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻, Cathode: 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g). Write the overall ionic equation.","Answer: (a)(i) Oxidation is the loss of electrons and reduction is the gain of electrons. (a)(ii) Chlorine (Cl₂) is the oxidising agent because it accepts electrons from bromide ions, allowing them to be oxidised to bromine. (b) Overall ionic equation: 2Cl⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) → Cl₂(g) + H₂(g)."
"Question 1: The equation for a reaction is: Ca(OH)₂(aq) + 2HNO₃(aq) → Ca(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2H₂O(l). Which description is correct? Options: A) oxidation only; B) reduction only; C) both oxidation and reduction; D) neither oxidation nor reduction.","Answer: D. Explanation: There is no change in oxidation states (Calcium remains +2, oxygen remains -2, hydrogen +1, and nitrogen in the nitrate ion remains +5), so the reaction involves neither oxidation nor reduction."
"Question 2: What is the oxidation number of chlorine in the KClO₃⁻ ion? Options: A) -1; B) +1; C) +4; D) +5.","Answer: C. Explanation: Although the normal calculation for ClO₃⁻ would yield an oxidation state of +5 for chlorine, the provided answer key indicates +4. This discrepancy is noted and may be due to a typo or error in the source."
"Question 6: A 6 cm³ sample of 0.1 M KMnO₄ is dissolved in water to make 100 cm³ of solution. What is the concentration of permanganate ions? Options: A) 0.006 M; B) 0.01 M; C) 0.06 M; D) 1.67 M.","Answer: A (0.006 M). Explanation: The moles of KMnO₄ in the sample equal (6/1000 L)×0.1 M = 0.0006 moles. Diluting to 0.1 L gives a concentration of 0.0006/0.1 = 0.006 M. Since KMnO₄ produces one MnO₄⁻ per formula unit, the permanganate ion concentration is 0.006 M."
"Question 7: Most chlorine-based bleaches contain the ClO⁻ ion. (a) State the systematic name of the ClO⁻ ion. (b) In aqueous solution, the ClO⁻ ion acts as an oxidising agent; give the half-equation for the reduction of ClO⁻ to Cl⁻ in acidic conditions. (c) Provide the formula of a potassium salt containing the ClO₄⁻ ion. (d) Write an equation for the disproportionation of chlorine in alkaline solution to form Cl⁻ and ClO₃⁻ ions.","Answer: (a) Chlorate(I). (b) ClO⁻ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cl⁻ + H₂O. (c) KClO₄. (d) 3Cl₂(aq) + 6OH⁻(aq) → 5Cl⁻(aq) + ClO₃⁻(aq) + 3H₂O(l). Explanation: These responses give the systematic name for ClO⁻, the redox half-reaction under acidic conditions, the correct salt formula for the +7 oxidation state ion, and a balanced equation for chlorine disproportionation under alkaline conditions."
