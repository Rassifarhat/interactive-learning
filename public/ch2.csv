"1. Complete the table below to show the numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons in these atoms, molecules and ions. (Table details: ³H, ¹⁸O²⁻, ²⁴Mg²⁺, ¹⁴N₁¹H₃, ¹⁴N₂⁷H₄⁺)","Table completed as follows: For ³H: Number of protons = 1, neutrons = 2, electrons = 1; For ¹⁸O²⁻: protons = 8, neutrons = 10, electrons = 10; For ²⁴Mg²⁺: protons = 12, neutrons = 12, electrons = 10; For ¹⁴N₁¹H₃: protons = 7 (from N) + 3 (from H) = 10, neutrons = 7, electrons = 10; For ¹⁴N₂⁷H₄⁺: protons = 14 (2×N) + 4 (H) = 18, neutrons = 14, electrons = 17."
"2. A sample of copper contains two isotopes of relative isotopic mass 63.0 and 65.0. If the relative atomic mass of copper is 63.5, calculate the relative abundance of each isotope.","Let x = abundance of Cu-63 and (1-x) = abundance of Cu-65. Then 63.0x + 65.0(1-x) = 63.5. Solving: 63.0x + 65.0 – 65.0x = 63.5 → –2.0x = –1.5 → x = 0.75. Therefore, Cu-63 = 75% and Cu-65 = 25%."
"3. The mass spectrum of bromine vapor (Br₂) is shown in a diagram. a) What are the relative isotopic masses of the two isotopes present in bromine? b) Identify the particles responsible for the peaks at m/z 158, 160 and 162. c) Deduce the relative abundance of the two isotopes and explain the relative heights of the three peaks.","a) The isotopic masses are 79 and 81. b) The peaks correspond to: m/z 158: ⁷⁹Br-⁷⁹Br, m/z 160: ⁷⁹Br-⁸¹Br, m/z 162: ⁸¹Br-⁸¹Br. c) Using the given peak height ratio of 9:6:1, the probabilities work out to 75% for ⁷⁹Br and 25% for ⁸¹Br, which explains the relative intensities."
"4. Calculate the relative atomic mass of a sample of magnesium that has the following isotopic composition: magnesium-24: 78.6%, magnesium-25: 10.1%, magnesium-26: 11.3%. Give your answer to three significant figures.","Ar = (24 × 0.786) + (25 × 0.101) + (26 × 0.113) = 18.864 + 2.525 + 2.938 = 24.327, which rounds to 24.3 (to 3 s.f.)."
"5. Using box notation, give the electronic configuration of: a) sulfur, b) phosphorus, c) chromium. Explain any unusual features in your answers.","a) Sulfur (Z=16): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁴; b) Phosphorus (Z=15): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³; c) Chromium (Z=24): [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹ – this is unusual because the expected configuration [Ar] 3d⁴ 4s² rearranges to a half‐filled 3d subshell for extra stability."
"6. Which of the following elements has no paired p electrons in a single uncombined atom: A. carbon, B. oxygen, C. fluorine, D. neon?","C. fluorine – its electronic configuration (1s² 2s² 2p⁵) leaves one unpaired electron in the p orbitals."
"7. Explain why the first ionisation energy of oxygen is less than that of nitrogen, even though the nuclear charge of oxygen is greater.","Oxygen’s 2p electrons experience greater electron–electron repulsion (especially in a paired orbital) compared to nitrogen’s half‐filled 2p orbitals, making it slightly easier to remove an electron from oxygen despite its higher nuclear charge."
"8. Which of the following electronic configurations is that of an atom of an element which forms a simple ion with a charge of –3? A. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p¹; B. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³; C. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d¹ 4s²; D. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁹ 4s²","B. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³ – this configuration (typical of phosphorus) requires an addition of three electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration."
"9. The five ionisation energies of boron are: 801, 2427, 3660, 25026, 32828 kJ/mol. a) State and justify the group in which boron is placed. b) Which option represents the second ionisation energy? (Options provided) c) Explain why the second ionisation energy is larger than the first. d) Explain why boron’s first ionisation energy is less than that of beryllium.","a) Boron is in Group 13 as it has 3 valence electrons; the large jump between the third and fourth ionisation energies indicates removal from a core shell. b) The second ionisation energy is: B⁺(g) → B²⁺(g) + e⁻ with ΔH = +2427 kJ/mol. c) After losing one electron, the effective nuclear charge increases and the remaining electrons are held more tightly. d) Although boron has a greater nuclear charge than beryllium, its valence electron is in a higher energy 2p orbital (less strongly held) compared to beryllium’s 2s electron."
"10. The table gives the first four ionisation energies of five elements (A–E). a) Which two elements are in the same group? Explain your answer. b) In which group is element C likely to occur? Explain your answer. c) Which element requires the least energy to form a 2+ ion? Explain your answer.","a) Elements A and B are in the same group (Group 2) as indicated by a large jump after removing two electrons. b) Element C, showing a jump after the third ionisation, is likely in Group 13. c) Element B requires the least energy to form a 2+ ion; its sum of the first two ionisation energies (738 + 1451 = 2189 kJ/mol) is the lowest among the five."
"11. The first four ionisation energies of calcium are 590, 1145, 4912 and 6474 kJ/mol. a) Explain why the second ionisation energy is larger than the first. b) Explain why the third ionisation energy is much larger than the second.","a) Removal of the first electron increases the effective nuclear charge, so the second electron is more tightly bound. b) The third electron is removed from a lower, more stable inner shell (a core electron), which requires a much larger energy input."
"12. Draw a sketch graph for the logarithm (base 10) of the successive ionisation energies of phosphorus.","The graph would show a modest, gradual increase for the first three electrons (from the 3p orbital), a steeper rise for the removal of the 3s electrons, then a very large jump when core electrons (from the 2p, 2s, and 1s orbitals) begin to be removed. (A rough sketch with these step changes is expected.)"
"13. Would you expect the first ionisation energy of gallium (Ga) to be higher or lower than that of calcium (Ca)? Explain your answer.","Gallium’s first ionisation energy is lower because, despite a higher nuclear charge, its 4p electron is shielded by a filled 3d subshell, reducing the effective nuclear attraction relative to calcium’s 4s electron."
"14. Explain the general trend in first ionisation energy of the elements Na to Ar in Period 3 of the Periodic Table.","From Na to Ar, the first ionisation energy generally increases due to the steadily increasing nuclear charge with only a slight increase in shielding, resulting in a stronger attraction for the valence electrons."
"15. The table shows melting temperatures and bonding/structure data for elements in Periods 2 and 3. a) Complete the 'bonding' row for Period 3 (use only 'metallic' or 'covalent'). b) Complete the 'structure' row for Period 3 (use only 'simple molecular' or 'giant lattice'). c) Explain why the melting temperature of phosphorus is different from that of silicon.","a) For Period 3: Na, Mg, Al are metallic; Si, P, S, Cl are covalent. b) For Period 3: Na, Mg, Al, Si have a giant lattice; P, S, Cl are simple molecular. c) Phosphorus has a very low melting point because it exists as discrete P₄ molecules with weak intermolecular forces, unlike silicon, which has a strong giant covalent lattice requiring high energy to break."
"16. An element has very high melting and boiling temperatures. a) What type of structure is it likely to have? b) Which physical property would help you determine whether the bonding is metallic or covalent? Explain your answer.","a) It is likely to have a giant lattice structure. b) Electrical conductivity: metallic substances conduct electricity in the solid state due to free electrons, whereas covalent (giant) structures do not conduct in the solid state."
"17. Lithium has two isotopes, ⁶Li and ⁷Li. A sample contains 7.59% ⁶Li and 92.41% ⁷Li. a) Given the isotopic masses (6.015 for ⁶Li and 7.016 for ⁷Li), calculate the relative atomic mass of lithium (to three significant figures). b) Would you expect the two isotopes to have the same chemical properties? Justify your answer.","a) Relative atomic mass = (6.015 × 0.0759) + (7.016 × 0.9241) ≈ 6.94 (to 3 s.f.). b) Yes; both isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons, so their chemical behavior is virtually identical despite differences in neutron number."
"18. Chlorine has two isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl. The mass spectrum of chlorine gas shows peaks at m/z 70, 72, and 74. a) Give the formula of the species responsible for each peak. b) Provide the m/z ratio and formula for the two additional peaks and state their relative abundance.","a) m/z 70: ³⁵Cl-³⁵Cl (Cl₂); m/z 72: ³⁵Cl-³⁷Cl (Cl₂); m/z 74: ³⁷Cl-³⁷Cl (Cl₂). b) The two additional peaks are due to atomic chlorine ions: m/z 35 (³⁵Cl⁺) and m/z 37 (³⁷Cl⁺), with a relative abundance that corresponds to a 3:1 ratio for ³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl."
"19. Today, the elemental fingerprints in the light from distant galaxies show a phenomenon called 'red shift'. Explain (in 200–300 words) how red shift has provided evidence for an expanding universe, making your explanation understandable to 16-year-old students.","Spectroscopic analysis of light from distant galaxies reveals that their characteristic elemental spectral lines are shifted toward longer (red) wavelengths. This red shift is analogous to the Doppler effect, where a sound’s pitch lowers as its source moves away. Just as a receding siren sounds lower in pitch, the red shift indicates that galaxies are moving away from us. The degree of red shift increases with distance, suggesting that the farther a galaxy is, the faster it recedes. This observation supports the idea that the universe is expanding—like spots on an inflating balloon moving apart as it grows. The fact that almost every galaxy shows this red shift implies that space itself is stretching, a key evidence for the Big Bang theory. In simple terms, the red shift tells us that the universe began from an extremely dense and hot state and has been expanding ever since. By measuring how much the light is shifted, astronomers can estimate the rate of the universe’s expansion, deepening our understanding of cosmic history. For a 16-year-old, imagine that the light from galaxies is like the sound from a car’s engine that changes pitch as the car speeds away—this change in light (red shift) is the clue that shows our universe is constantly growing."
