"Explain two limitations of a file-based approach to storing data, using examples from the theatrical agency scenario.","One limitation is data redundancy and possible inconsistency in multiple files. For instance, the agency stored member names and band names in the Contract and Recruitment files, leading to potential discrepancies if an update wasn’t made in all files. Another limitation is the lack of data privacy in a single file, where, for example, the recruitment section could access band members’ banking details intended only for the finance section."
How does a relational database address the data integrity problems seen in the single file example? Provide a specific example from the text.,"A relational database can prevent data integrity problems through built-in controls like primary keys ensuring unique records and foreign keys enforcing relationships between tables. For example, defining BandName as a foreign key in the Member table, referencing the primary key in the Band table, prevents the entry of a member belonging to a non-existent band."
"What is a primary key in a relational database, and why is it important?",A primary key is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each tuple (row) in a table. It is crucial for ensuring that each record is distinct and provides a reliable way to reference specific data within the table.
Explain the concept of a foreign key and how it helps to ensure referential integrity between tables.,"A foreign key is an attribute in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a link between the two. It ensures referential integrity by preventing actions that would break these links, such as entering a foreign key value that doesn’t exist in the referenced primary key table."
"In entity-relationship modeling, what is an entity, and how does it relate to a table in a relational database?","In entity-relationship modeling, an entity (or entity type) represents a real-world object, person, event, or concept about which data needs to be stored. Each entity type will typically become a separate table in a relational database."
Describe the difference between a 1:M and an M:M relationship in the context of entity-relationship modeling. How is an M:M relationship typically resolved in a logical model?,"A 1:M (one-to-many) relationship means that one instance of an entity can be related to zero, one, or many instances of another entity, while each instance of the second entity relates to only one instance of the first. An M:M (many-to-many) relationship means that many instances of one entity can be related to many instances of another entity. An M:M relationship is typically resolved in a logical model by introducing a link entity (or junction table) that uses foreign keys to reference the primary keys of the original entities."
What is the goal of normalization in database design? Briefly describe the purpose of converting data to first normal form (1NF).,"The goal of normalization is to design database tables in a way that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity. Conversion to first normal form (1NF) involves ensuring that each table has a primary key and that all attributes have atomic (single) values, eliminating repeating groups of data."
Explain the key difference between second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF) in the normalization process.,"In 2NF, a table must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, moving attributes partially dependent on a composite key to new tables. In 3NF, a table must be in 2NF, and all non-key attributes must be non-transitively dependent on the primary key, moving attributes dependent on other non-key attributes to separate tables."
Describe the three levels of the ANSI/SPARC database architecture and the role of the Database Management System (DBMS) within this architecture.,"The three levels are the external level (individual user views of the data), the conceptual level (a single, universal view of the data organization), and the internal level (how the data is physically stored). The DBMS is the software that manages and controls the database at all three levels, handling data storage, retrieval, security, and integrity."
"Briefly explain the purpose of SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML), providing one example of each.","SQL DDL is used to define the structure of the database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables. An example is CREATE TABLE Band (BandName varchar(25), NumberOfMembers integer);. SQL DML is used to interact with the data stored in the database, including inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data. An example is SELECT BandName FROM Band;."
"Discuss the impact of emerging technologies (such as AI, IoT, and blockchain) on society and the economy. Provide examples of benefits and potential risks associated with these technologies.","Emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain drive innovation, efficiency, and new business models. AI automates tasks, enhances decision-making, and powers applications like self-driving cars. IoT connects devices for smart environments but raises security and privacy concerns. Blockchain enables secure, decentralized transactions but faces scalability and regulatory challenges. Benefits include productivity gains and new services; risks involve job displacement, surveillance, and misuse."
"Explain the ethical considerations in the development and deployment of computer systems. Discuss how professional codes of conduct and legal frameworks guide responsible computing.","Ethical considerations include privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Developers must avoid bias, protect user data, and ensure systems do not cause harm. Professional codes (e.g., ACM, IEEE) and laws (e.g., GDPR) provide guidelines for responsible conduct, balancing innovation with societal good."
